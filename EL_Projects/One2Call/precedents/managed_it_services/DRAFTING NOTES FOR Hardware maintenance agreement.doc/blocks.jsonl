Although primarily a hardware maintenance agreement, the agreement also covers updates to software where these are provided with the hardware, see .\n \n \nAssumptions\n \nIt is assumed for the purpose of this standard document that:\n \nThe supplier and the customer are UK limited companies, and the customer is a business user.\nThe agreement has been drafted in consideration of, and is subject to, English law.\nAny goods or services to be provided under the agreement, are to be provided in the UK exclusively. (If goods or services are to be provided in jurisdictions outside the UK, the laws of those jurisdictions will need to be considered, separately, by each party).\nNo specific cybersecurity standards apply to the parties, or to any goods or services that are to be provided under this agreement, under English law (or the law of any other jurisdiction). For more information, see .\n \nCybersecurity\n \nCybersecurity obligations are becoming more prominent in IT agreements, including as statutory controls and obligations in relation to network and information system, and data, security are increasing, see:\n \n.\n:\nSpecific UK cybersecurity legal standards may apply in particular circumstances, including in relation to:\n \nCertain regulated activities and sectors, see .\nCertain operators of essential services and relevant digital service providers, see .\nCertain consumer connectable products, see .\nPersonal data, see .\nCyber laws in other jurisdictions may also apply extraterritorially to organisations in the UK, depending on where goods and services are being provided. By way of example, see .\n \nThis agreement is drafted on the assumption that no specific cybersecurity laws or legal standards apply to the parties, or to the goods or services which are the subject matter of this agreement, in the UK or elsewhere, see . If they do, then this may necessitate the inclusion of certain provisions into the agreement, or the party subject to the requirements may wish to flow them down to their counterparty.\n \nTo determine whether a legal requirement applies, a cybersecurity risk assessment may be necessary or helpful. For more information on conducting cybersecurity risk assessments, see . For more information about managing cyber risk in an organisation’s supply chain, see .\n \n \nOperators of essential services and relevant digital service providers\nThe  (NIS Regulations) which came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the  (also known as the NIS Directive). They have potential impact on:\n \nAny operator of essential services (OES) that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure.\nRelevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).\nLike the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.\n \nThe banking and financial market infrastructures sectors were omitted from the NIS Regulations although they fall within the Cybersecurity Directive. The UK government stated in its consultation on implementation of the Directive that competent authorities for these sectors would not be identified. Firms and financial market infrastructure within these sectors must continue to adhere to requirements and standards as set by the Bank of England and/or the Financial Conduct Authority.\n \nFor a definition of an OES see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .\n \nOESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OESs).\n \nThis agreement is drafted on the assumption that the NIS Regulations do not apply (either directly or indirectly). Where the NIS Regulations apply to the Customer, it will need to consider whether the obligations placed on the Supplier with regard to maintenance of the Customer’s hardware (and associated software) are sufficient to meet any enhanced cybersecurity requirements under the NIS Regulations. The National Cyber Security Centre has published  for OESs which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances.\n \nThe Customer should also refer to any specific guidance issued by the regulator for their specific OES sector (or by the ICO for RDSPs) and any applicable guidance for the banking and financial market infrastructures sectors, see .\n \nHardware maintenance can be a key way of protecting the Customer’s system from cybersecurity threats, and so (whether the NIS Regulations apply or not) the Customer may wish to place the Supplier under a specific obligation to maintain the security of any software which runs on the hardware, as well as its functional operation, see .\n \nIn addition, during hardware maintenance the Customer and Supplier systems may interface with each other, and so the Customer may want to impose an additional obligation on the Supplier not to introduce vulnerabilities into the Customer’s network and information systems. As drafted, currently only covers viruses.\n \nFor an example of additional cybersecurity requirements that could be included here (albeit in the context of software, rather than hardware, maintenance) see . Please note these requirements are general in nature and not aligned to any sectoral requirements, so if the NIS Regulations do apply, you should always consult the specific guidance that applies for your sector.\n \nConsumer connectable products\nManufacturers, distributors and importers of certain consumer connectable in the UK (such as certain, qualifying smart products, like smart TVs, smart speakers, connected baby monitors and connected alarm systems) are subject to minimum cybersecurity requirements under Part 1 of the  (PSTIA). A party who is subject to these requirements might seek to include specific clauses in its maintenance arrangements with third parties to ensure that the cybersecurity of such products are preserved.\n \nFor more information on the requirements of the PSTIA, see .\n \nData protection\n \nWhere  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at , or, alternatively, a data protection schedule will need to be annexed to this agreement.\n \nThe clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.\n \nFor some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:\n \n.\n.\nEach set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.\n \nFor a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .\n \nSupply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking\n \nThe  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.\n \nThe Supplier should note that the Customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the Supplier will comply with the Customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the Supplier may require the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.\n \nFor further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .\n  \nDrafting for Brexit\n \nOn 31 January 2020 (), the UK left the EU and the UK-EU withdrawal agreement entered into force. Following the end of the  at 11.00 pm UK time on 31 December 2020,  was created, the remaining withdrawal agreement provisions came into operation, and the  (including the UK-EU trade and co-operation agreement) started to apply on a provisional basis, eventually entering into force at 11.00 pm (UK time) on 30 April 2021. This resource has been reviewed and reflects the position from the end of the transition period.\n \nFor general information on the withdrawal agreement, future relationship agreements, and the operation of UK law following the end of the transition period, see  and Practical Law’s .\n \nFor more information on the impact of Brexit on the specific practice areas covered by this resource, see:\n \n.\n.\n.\nSee also .\n \nFor guidance on the issues to consider when assessing the possible impact of Brexit when drafting an agreement, see , which includes specimen Brexit clauses.","style":"Normal","level":null,"section_id":"60d5f952-8eb8-40ce-b267-29554d9ae401","list":null,"table":{"table_id":"tbl_1","row":0,"col":0},"anchor":null,"metadata":null,"heading":{"text":"Body (no heading)","source":"none","fallback_label":"Body (no heading)"},"runs":[{"text":"About this document","formats":["bold"]},{"text":" ","formats":[]},{"text":"An agreement drafted from the Supplier’s point of view, in which the Supplier agrees to provide support and maintenance for certain hardware supplied by the Supplier.
