# Client Instructions

**Subject:** [CUSTOMER] Trail Contract Template

## Email Body

Dear David,

I hope you are well!

We recently received a Trial contract from [CUSTOMER]. Unfortunately, our US lawyers have a conflict of interest and cannot advise on this matter.

While this contract is governed by US law, we would greatly appreciate your initial comments on the risks from a general legal perspective. I have included my initial notes below, but please also highlight any other concerns or risks you perceive.

Here are the key points I initially noted. 


- 3.3 AI Use: We use machine learning in our software, but not Large Language Models (LLMs). Could you suggest clarifying language to add to Exhibit 1 regarding this distinction?
- 5.0 Fees (Payment Terms): The current payment term is 75 days. Since our standard term is 30 days, we would like to suggest a compromise of 45 days.
- 10.0 Indemnification: The current language suggests unlimited liability. As a small startup, we need to cap this at $1 million, which is consistent with our current insurance limit.
- Exhibit A Third-Party Security Standard: Given that we are not integrating with their system, I recommend limiting this section so that only a few specific and relevant clauses apply to us.

Thank you for your assistance with this and if you are able to advise as soon possible that would be very helpful. 

Thanks Anna

      Confidential Information

      **1.** Confidentiality. Each Party shall maintain in confidence any and all information and materials disclosed or made available by or on behalf of the other Party (“Discloser”) or that the receiving Party (“Recipient”) obtains in connection with this Trial that is designated or that is reasonably expected to be confidential or proprietary under the circumstances (including the existence and terms of this Trial and the Parties’ trade secrets, business, technical and financial information not generally known to the public, such as business plans, strategies, metadata) (“Confidential Information”). NBCU Data and all metadata therein is [CUSTOMER]’s Confidential Information. Confidential Information does not include information that (a) Recipient rightfully possessed without a duty of confidentiality before obtaining it from Discloser; (b) is or becomes generally available to and known by the public through no fault of Recipient; (c) Recipient received on an unrestricted basis from a source unrelated to either Party and not under a duty of confidentiality with respect to the information; or (d) Recipient developed independently.

      **2.** Obligations. Recipient shall maintain in confidence Discloser’s Confidential Information and protect that Confidential Information from any unauthorized disclosure, access, use, destruction, alteration or loss, exercising at least the same degree of care as Recipient exercises for its own confidential and proprietary information, but not less than a reasonable degree of care. Subject to Sections 3, 4 and 7 of this Exhibit 2, Recipient shall not, nor permit or assist any person to, (a) use or copy Discloser’s Confidential Information, except as permitted in the Trial or as otherwise necessary to perform or receive the [SUPPLIER] IP or to otherwise perform Recipient’s obligations under the Trial; or (b) disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to any person other than disclosures to Recipients’ then-current Affiliates and its and their authorized Personnel, legal counsel, accountants, banks and other financing sources and advisors as strictly necessary for such parties to advise or perform on behalf of Recipient or its applicable Affiliates (such persons, “Authorized Persons”). Recipient shall ensure that its Authorized Persons with access to Discloser’s Confidential Information are bound by written confidentiality obligations, or are otherwise under a duty of confidentiality, sufficient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information in a manner that is consistent with this Exhibit.

      **3.** Required Disclosure. [SUPPLIER] shall, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, (a) notify [CUSTOMER] within three (3)  business days (provided that [SUPPLIER] shall give such notice at least one business day prior to the applicable deadline for response) if any Applicable Law requires, or a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction requires or requests, that [SUPPLIER] disclose [CUSTOMER]’s Confidential Information; and (b) use reasonable efforts to allow [CUSTOMER] an opportunity to seek injunctive relief from, or a protective order with respect to, the contemplated disclosure. If notification to [CUSTOMER] is prohibited by Applicable Law, or if it is not prohibited and that relief or order is not obtained, [SUPPLIER] (i) may disclose only that portion of [CUSTOMER]’s Confidential Information that [SUPPLIER]’s counsel advises is not subject to privilege and must be disclosed; and (ii) shall, at [CUSTOMER]’s expense, cooperate with [CUSTOMER]’s efforts to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law to ensure the disclosed Confidential Information is treated in a confidential manner after disclosure.

      **4.** Newsworthy Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Trial, any disclosure by [CUSTOMER] or Affiliates of Confidential Information in the ordinary course of their business of disseminating news and information is not a breach of the Trial; provided that the individuals involved in such dissemination received such Confidential Information from a source other than the Personnel of [CUSTOMER] (not including [SUPPLIER] or its Personnel) involved in the Trial.

      **5.** Destruction/Return of Information. At Discloser’s request, or following any termination of the Trial, Recipient shall stop using Discloser’s Confidential Information, and, except as necessary to comply with Applicable Law, return to Discloser or destroy, at Discloser’s option, all of Discloser’s Confidential Information in Recipient’s or its Authorized Persons’ possession or control. Where [CUSTOMER] is the Discloser, such return or destruction shall be consistent with the [CUSTOMER] Security Standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, [CUSTOMER] is not required to return or destroy [SUPPLIER]’s Confidential Information backed up from a computer system in the ordinary course of [CUSTOMER]’s business, but that Confidential Information remains subject to all applicable obligations under the Trial.

      **6.** Confidentiality Term. Recipient’s obligations under this Exhibit regarding Discloser’s Confidential Information terminate five years after the end of the Term, except that Recipient’s obligations survive (a) for backed up Confidential Information, in accordance with Section 5 of this Exhibit 2; (b) for Data, in perpetuity; and (c) for Confidential Information that is a trade secret, for as long as such Confidential Information is a trade secret under Applicable Law.

         ---

         ## 1. Introduction

         [CUSTOMER] recognizes information protection requires close cooperation between [CUSTOMER] and Service Provider. This Third Party Security Standard (this "Standard") outlines [CUSTOMER] security requirements designed to safeguard [CUSTOMER] Data from unauthorized or accidental modification, damage, destruction, loss, or disclosure, and to protect [CUSTOMER] Systems.

         ## 2. Scope

         These requirements are applicable to all Third Parties, including but not limited to Service Providers, that: (i) manage or have access to [CUSTOMER] Data; (ii) have a connection to [CUSTOMER] Systems or the [CUSTOMER] network; or (iii) provide work product or other deliverables to [CUSTOMER].

         ## 3. Establishing Security Requirements

         This Standard defines the baseline information security requirements. [CUSTOMER] may require additional or modified requirements in the Agreement based on the nature of the Services and the risk of the engagement. Requirements set forth in this Standard apply to all Third Parties and shall not be deemed to limit any Third Party obligations under the Agreement.

         ## 4. Basic Security Requirements

         ### 4.1 Vulnerability Management

         As outlined in NIST 800-40 Rev 3 and/or ISO 27001/2, Service Provider will keep its systems and software up to date with the latest upgrades, updates, bug fixes/patches, new versions, and other modifications necessary to ensure security of the [CUSTOMER] Data.

         ### 4.2 Endpoint Detection and Threat Response

         Service Provider will at all times use endpoint detection and threat response software to protect its Systems and will keep the endpoint detection and threat response software up to date. Service Provider will mitigate threats from all Viruses, spyware, and other malicious code that are or should reasonably have been detected.

         ### 4.3 Disconnection of Third-Party Devices

         [CUSTOMER] reserves the right to disconnect a Service Provider device from [CUSTOMER] Systems should the device contain zero-day, critical, or high findings and vulnerabilities.

         ### 4.4 Access Controls

         #### 4.4.1 Unique Accounts

         Service Provider user accounts that may be used to access [CUSTOMER] Data or Systems must not be shared. Each such user account may only be assigned to one individual.

         #### 4.4.2 User Management

         Service Provider must have a demonstrable and documented identity and user account lifecycle management process, which addresses privileged account management and user access review, user account verification, deletion, and disablement.

         #### 4.4.3 Account Termination

         Service Provider shall disable or enable [CUSTOMER] to disable the access credentials of any of the Service Provider's Personnel with access to [CUSTOMER] Systems or [CUSTOMER] Data whose engagement or employment is terminated within 24 hours of the termination.

         #### 4.4.4 Least Privilege Access

         All [CUSTOMER] Data must be protected with appropriate access controls to guard against improper access, disclosure, modification, loss, and deletion.

         #### 4.4.5 MFA

         Service Provider shall implement Modern Authentication and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Personnel accessing any Internet Facing application, software, or system that accesses, transmits, receives, collects, generates, uses, stores, processes, or shares [CUSTOMER] Level 3 Confidential and Level 4 Restricted Data. APIs and similar Internet Facing interfaces accessing or processing [CUSTOMER] Data should utilise Modern Authentication with more than one authentication technique wherever technically feasible or required.

         #### 4.4.6 Key Rotation

         If requested by [CUSTOMER], Service Provider will promptly undertake encryption key and any other access credential rotation, even if this is outside of Service Provider's regular rotation schedule.

         ### 4.5 Log Management

         #### 4.5.1 Retention

         Logs must be stored, protected, and reviewed as necessary for the computing environment. Except where applicable privacy laws require the redaction or deletion of Personal Data, unmodified security logs must be maintained for a period of at least one (1) year from recording of the applicable logs. Logs must be made available to [CUSTOMER] if requested for investigation or remediation.

         #### 4.5.2 Log Sharing

         For Systems that store, access or process Confidential Level 3 Data or Restricted Level 4 Data, logs must be shared with [CUSTOMER]'s Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment in an automated process. If a SIEM is not available, Service Provider must remove all other customer data and share the logs with [CUSTOMER] promptly upon request.

         ### 4.6 Subcontractors

         #### 4.6.1

         Service Provider is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Personnel and the use of Subcontractors shall not relieve any Third Party of any responsibility under this Standard.

         #### 4.6.2

         Service Provider must ensure a written agreement that includes security requirements at least as protective as those set forth herein is executed between Service Provider and any Subcontractor that processes [CUSTOMER] Data or accesses [CUSTOMER] Systems as part of the Services.

         #### 4.6.3

         Service Provider must conduct periodic reviews of its Subcontractors' security controls to confirm that those controls meet these security requirements.

         #### 4.6.4

         In the event Service Provider identifies deficiencies in any such Subcontractor's security controls, Service Provider must maintain a report of such findings and ensure that such deficiencies are remediated within a reasonable timeframe, commensurate with their severity.

         ### 4.7 Personnel – Technical & Security Awareness Training

         #### 4.7.1

         Service Provider must ensure that its Personnel are properly trained for the type of data, Systems and information assets they interact with, including appropriate technical training.

         #### 4.7.2

         Service Provider must maintain a security awareness program in accordance with industry best practices to address the evolving security threats introduced by human behavior. Training must be at least annual, and content should be relevant to the nature of Service Provider's function and culture.

         ### 5.2 Data Classification

         Service Provider must have a demonstrable process to manage and protect [CUSTOMER] Data in accordance with its classification level identified by [CUSTOMER], with reference to the [CUSTOMER] Classification Table in Figure 1. [CUSTOMER] has the right to determine and reassign the data classification level on all data managed by Service Provider.

## Email Body

Hi Anna,

 

I am very sorry for the delay.

 

Please see attached for my comments.  Things to flag:

 

*	AI/machine learning (3.3., Ex. 1)– please check my proposed wording in Exhibit 1 carefully, especially the statements on training data, use of [CUSTOMER] Data. Please also add details of any third party suppliers you use for this.
*	Subcontractors/suppliers/service providers (3.4) – please list these in Exhibit 1 if they will have access to any [CUSTOMER] Data – n.b. this would include cloud service providers who merely host [CUSTOMER] data. 
*	IP in outputs (4) – please let me know if they are only able to use the outputs during the term of the agreement.  At the moment, they own the IP in the outputs.
*	Affiliates (3.1) – are you happy for the entire [CUSTOMER] group to benefit from the trial?
*	Warranties/indemnities (3.2 and 9 and 10) – see my comments on whether to push back or accept.
*	Data security (8 and Ex. 3) – I have proposed to limit Exhibit 3 to clauses 6 (Data Retention and Descruction), 8 (Cyber Security Incidents) and 9 (Application and Software Requirements) which look reasonable (and probably align with your existing practices).  Please check these look ok – or let me know if you would like me to provide more detail on this.
*	Liability cap (11) – I have added a general liability cap (100% of the fees) and a supercap of $1m for the indemnity in clause 10 (i.e. IPR, confidentiality, security).
*	Payment terms (5) – I have amended from 75 to 45 days, as per your email.

 

I have availability today if you would like to discuss anything or if you would like me to edit anything.

 

If you are comfortable with these changes, please delete the internal comments, marked For [SUPPLIER].   The comments marked For [CUSTOMER] are safe for sharing with them.

 

Thanks,
