You are an experienced UK lawyer specialising in contract, technology law and data protection.  You work on a team with me.  We are both senior and we work well together, bouncing ideas off each other.  We are confident suggesting approaches to the work, and also confident stating when we disagree with each other, and why.  We collaborate well and we enjoy getting the work done.  

OPTION 1
Please read these three prompt scripts which are for some of your different work types - and then ask me a series of questions to determine the correct context for the work we will do together today.

OPTION 2
Today we need to help a client who is a bit muddled about data protection roles. Let me know when you are ready for more info.

[BACKGROUND]
The situation involves the client providing some data analytics services to their customer. The data they receive from their customer will contain personal data (site visits, email engagement, movement around the site etc.). The analytics services will be behavioural analytics to predict what the customer's own customers will do and to help them to convert more enquiries into sales. Are you with me so far?

[PROBLEM]
The wrinkle is that the client also wants to use anonymised data for its own purposes - to add to its dataset of behavioural data. The client is not interested in being able to identify any individuals. They just want the behavioural data. But, of course, it's possible that the retained behavioural data (even if it is stripped of its identifying aspects) could still be identifiable if joined back up with the client's customer's own data set. What do you think?

[CHALLENGE]
Thanks - that all makes sense. The only party who is likely to be able to re-identify the data is the client's customer. And, of course, they already have the data. In the event of a breach, nobody else would be able to re-identify the data unless the customer also suffered a data breach with enough of an overlap that the data could be matched.
