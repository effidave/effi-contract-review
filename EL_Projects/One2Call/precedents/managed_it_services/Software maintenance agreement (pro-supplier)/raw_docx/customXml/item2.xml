              <paratext>The standard document is drafted from the supplier's perspective. However, it adopts a reasonably balanced approach to the relevant issues because an agreement which is drafted too much in favour of either party serves only to increase the time and cost of negotiations.

As new functionality is added or bugs are fixed, these are incorporated into the online application. This means that the application being accessed through a web browser is always the most up to date without the need for costly upgrades, and so various obligations set out in this agreement (for, example, relating to the provision of Maintenance Releases in <internal.reference refid="a513201"><ital>clause 2.2</ital></internal.reference>) will not apply.

              <para>
                <paratext>It is increasingly common for maintenance to be provided by third parties who do not own any rights in the software. The maintenance of software requires a licence from the software owner (or an authorised licensee with rights to sub-license) in the same way that use of the software must be licensed. Consequently, the maintainer needs to ensure either that it has an agreement with the software owner granting it the necessary rights (for example, as part of its appointment as an approved maintenance company), or that the customer is entitled to allow the maintainer to carry out work on the customer's behalf.</paratext>
              </para>
              <para>
                <paratext>Except where the customer is itself the software owner, it is unlikely that the customer will have the rights or information necessary to enable the maintainer to perform all its obligations under this standard document (at the very least, the maintainer will require access to the software owner in order to resolve technical issues), so an agreement between the software owner and the maintainer is likely to be required. To the extent that the supplier relies on the customer's rights it should request an indemnity from the customer in case those rights prove to be illusory.</paratext>
              </para>
              <para>
                <paratext>Although a maintenance agreement for on-premises software generally includes an obligation on the maintainer to provide new releases and versions of the software (referred to in the standard document as Modifications), the maintenance agreement will not usually deal with the customer's right to use those modifications. In other words, it does not constitute a licence of the software modifications. The standard document is drafted on the assumption that this right is contained in the licence under which the customer is given the right to use the software (referred to in the standard document as the Licence). If this were not the case, the maintenance agreement could be drafted to bring the modifications within the scope of that licence. However, where the maintainer is not the owner of the rights in the software, it is unlikely to have the rights to license the use of the modifications; its licence will normally be limited to supplying the media on which those modifications are recorded. In order to prevent it incurring any liability in those cases, a third-party maintainer should, before signature, satisfy itself that the customer does have a licence to use the modifications to the software which the maintainer has an obligation to provide.</paratext>

                <paratext>The supplier should seek to limit its liability to the customer under the maintenance agreement as, otherwise, it could face liability which far exceeds the sums it receives under the agreement if it is unable to provide an adequate level of service. Customers will usually accept some form of exclusion and limitation of liability, but suppliers need to draft such terms carefully so that they comply with the provisions of the <link href="7-505-7728" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977</ital></link> (UCTA), where this applies, see <link anchor="a241821" href="7-107-4789" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note: overview, Main issues in software licensing and maintenance contracts: Limitation of liability</ital></link>.

              <para>
                <paratext>The specimen agreement assumes that the contract will be performed in the UK. However, most maintenance services can now be provided remotely so suppliers will often wish to subcontract performance to individuals situated off-shore (for example, in India). These individuals may be employees of the supplier but will more likely be employees of a subsidiary or subcontractor. From a customer's point of view this potentially gives rise to a number of concerns, including:</paratext>

Unless there is to be an absolute prohibition on any processing being carried out off-shore, the parties will need to consider how transfers of personal data out of the UK (and where EU legislation applies, the EU) can be undertaken in compliance with the relevant data protection legislation.

As part of any risk assessment for security purposes the supplier will wish to consider the procedures it has in place to protect unauthorised access to data, screen its employees for security purposes, prevent removal of data from customer systems, and so on.

However, whether or not to include appropriate anti-bribery clauses in the relevant agreement is primarily an issue for the customer, rather than the supplier, to consider. The customer may be liable under <link href="2-505-7405" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>section 7</ital></link> of the BA 2010 for failure to prevent bribery by or on behalf of the supplier and inclusion of appropriate clauses may help it establish the defence that it has adequate procedures in place designed to prevent bribery by its associated persons. The supplier will not generally face a similar risk on account of the customer’s activities. Nevertheless, the supplier will, for example, need to consider whether to include appropriate clauses in any related subcontract or consultancy agreement which it may enter into for the acquisition of services or goods.

The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.</paratext>

                <paratext>The supplier should note that the customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the supplier will comply with the customer's policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the supplier may require the customer to comply with the supplier's business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.</paratext>

It might be reasonable to agree to such provisions, and in fact the supplier may have developed comprehensive processes and policies to support the services it provides (particularly if it is subject to the NIS Regulations as an RDSP itself).

              </head>
              <para>
                <paratext>There is a possibility that a  <link href="8-107-7424" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><bold><ital>TUPE</ital></bold></link> transfer could occur at the end of a maintenance agreement.  This could arise where the support and maintenance services are taken in-house or are re-tendered to a different supplier. Whether there is a risk of TUPE applying is highly fact dependant and would involve a consideration of the usual aspects of the test for a service provision change (see <link anchor="a586427" href="8-204-4041" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note, TUPE (3): service provision changes: What is a service provision change?</ital></link>).  One of the key questions is likely to be whether the activities to be carried out following the end of this agreement will be fundamentally the same as those carried out under this agreement (see <link anchor="a221430" href="8-204-4041" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note, TUPE (3): service provision changes: Fundamentally the same activities</ital></link>). It will also be relevant to consider whether certain of the maintenance staff have been dedicated wholly or substantially to supporting the customer in question (see <link anchor="a1017892" href="9-380-8518" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note, TUPE (4): the automatic transfer principle: Who transfers?</ital></link>). The customer will likely want to insert TUPE clauses which deal with the position on exit. From the customer's perspective, the exit provisions are intended to anticipate the future commercial considerations and the position of a subsequent supplier (with a view to extending protections to a subsequent supplier). The supplier, on the hand, is likely to seek entry provisions to deal with the risk of a TUPE transfer on entry</paratext>

                      <paratext>This is an important definition (for both parties) as often the supplier's obligations are defined by reference to the type of problem which the customer is experiencing with the software. It can help to ensure that the supplier has an obligation to provide support at a level that is appropriate to the problem which the customer is experiencing. However, defining the faults which the supplier of maintenance has an obligation to fix can be difficult. Sometimes they are defined by reference to specific documentation such as the specification for the software which sets out details of the software's functionality. This can result in a more objective definition.</paratext>

                      <paratext>This standard document only distinguishes between two levels of faults (see the definition of Non-Critical Fault) but many maintenance agreements adopt a more detailed categorisation. For example, faults in Categories 1 and 2 might require immediate attention, faults in Category 3 might require individual attention but at a more leisurely pace, while faults in Category 4 would be fixed, if at all, only in a maintenance release. The supplier should ensure that any such terms reflect its practice in the provision of maintenance.</paratext>

                      <paratext>It is not always easy to distinguish between a new version and a maintenance release. The two definitions should be considered in the light of the supplier's usual practice. <internal.reference refid="a456913"><ital>Drafting note, Supported software</ital></internal.reference>, which accompanies this standard document (and which provides more information on definitions of New Version), does not include new versions within the licence of the software on the basis that the supplier reserves the right to require a separate licence for a new version (see the definition of Modification in that licence). However, the supplier might well be prepared to support new versions under the maintenance agreement and, consequently, the definition of Modification in this standard document includes new versions. If new versions are not to be supported, the definition needs to be amended accordingly.</paratext>

                      <paratext>The customer will, therefore, want to resist any obligation to purchase a new version as a condition of obtaining continued support under the maintenance agreement. However, the supplier will want to avoid supporting multiple versions of its software. It is therefore not unusual for a supplier to agree to support the current version of its software and the immediately preceding versions (or the two immediately preceding), but to seek to be released from any obligation as regards earlier versions. An alternative approach, which has been adopted by at least one supplier recently, is to offer to support all versions of its software, but with the fee being directly related to the age of the software: the older it is, the greater the fee. The supplier should ensure that the terms of this clause reflect its practice in this respect.</paratext>

However, the second alternative can be used to put pressure on the customer to decide whether to accept or reject the new version much earlier on, that is, within seven days of delivery, and if it delays beyond that period it will be deemed to have accepted the new version under <internal.reference refid="a947090"><ital>clause 2.3</ital></internal.reference>.

                      <paratext>In general, suppliers will be more willing to contract for measures they can control (such as time to respond) than measures which may rely on others (such as mean time to repair, which might be dependent on parts, service or information from the manufacturer or distributor). As discussed, it is common for there to be a distinction between the times required to respond to or fix critical and non-critical faults, and sometimes support contracts justify the specification of a number of levels of faults each requiring its own response and fix times. If so, the service levels should be drafted to reflect the different obligations of the supplier in respect of each type of fault. Where the supplier is willing to accept them, it is important for it to ensure that the service levels are defined clearly.</paratext>

                    <paratext>In most goods or services agreements, the obligation is usually on the supplier to comply with the customer's policies. But this may not always be the case: depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, a supplier may well require the customer to comply with the supplier's policies instead. As this is a pro-supplier agreement, the supplier may want to omit this clause altogether from the first draft provided to the customer.</paratext>

                        <paratext>The first is a requirement on the customer to comply with the supplier's policies. This is slightly unusual (the usual position is that a supplier agrees to comply with the customer's policies), but a supplier who is concerned about its reputation may well want to ensure that it is only supplying goods or services to customers who are willing to comply with the supplier's policies on issues such as anti-bribery, modern slavery and ethics.</paratext>

In most cases the supplier will want the customer to be committed to the agreement for as long as possible and, consequently, a lengthy initial fixed term should be specified. In some cases this will suit the customer. For example, where the customer has made significant investment in acquiring and implementing the software and/or where there are not many suppliers who are able to support the software, it will not want to be left without support in the short term. However, in other cases, the customer will want a short initial fixed term (for example, where it is not sure if it will be using the software on a long-term basis or where it believes that maintenance may be available from other suppliers on better terms in the future). In those situations, a compromise may have to be reached.</paratext>

                  <paratext>The rights of the parties to terminate the agreement on notice for any reason during the term (as opposed to rights to terminate for breach or insolvency) also have to be considered in this context. Although the customer may seek long-term commitment from the supplier, the supplier should be unwilling to give up a right to terminate on notice as it may find that it is no longer viable to support the type of software concerned. However, a compromise may be found in terms of the length of the notice period. In fact, a longer notice period may be welcomed by a supplier which has taken on additional resources to provide the services to the customer as a longer notice period may provide time for it to find new customers or reduce those resources.</paratext>

The main purpose of an escrow agreement, which is entered into between the parties to a software licence and a third-party escrow agent, is to put the customer in a position where it will be able to maintain the software if the supplier becomes unable or unwilling to do so, by allowing it to access the source code for the software in certain specified circumstances (such as the insolvency of the software licensor) (see <link href="7-107-4789#a483447" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note, Main issues in software licensing and maintenance contracts: Escrow agreement</ital></link>).

                      <paratext>The supplier can avoid this difficulty in the case of exclusive licences only if, instead of placing an absolute ban on challenges to validity, it reserves the right to terminate the licence if the customer challenges validity. (Non-challenge and termination clauses solely concerning know-how are not excluded from the scope of the technology transfer block exemption (paragraph 140, <link href="_blank" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC">Guidelines on the application of Article 101 of the TFEU to technology transfer agreements (OJ 2014 C 89/3)</link> (Guidelines)). However, it is very unlikely that an exclusive licence to any of the supplier's intellectual property rights would be granted pursuant to a standard maintenance agreement.</paratext>

                      <paratext>The Guidelines state that a right for termination can have the same effect as a no challenge clause, in particular where switching away from the supplier's technology would result in significant loss to the customer (for example where the customer has already made specific investments for producing using the licensed technology) or where the supplier's technology is a necessary input for the customer's production (paragraph 136). However, the Guidelines also state that outside these scenarios, a termination clause will often not provide a significant disincentive to challenge the validity of intellectual property and therefore would not produce the same effect as a no challenge clause (paragraph 137). In these cases, a right of termination in the event of such a challenge may be acceptable on an individual assessment basis even in a non-exclusive licence, depending on the circumstances.</paratext>

                    <paratext>It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to "delete" electronic data. The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK's data protection authority) has opined that the term "deletion", in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.</paratext>
