# Email to Client: Lamplight Hosting Agreement Review

**To**: [Client Contact]  
**From**: [Lawyer Name]

**Subject**: Review of Lamplight Hosting Agreement – Summary and Recommendations

---

Dear [Client],

Thank you for instructing us to review your standard Hosting Agreement. We have now completed our analysis, comparing your terms against current market practice for B2B SaaS agreements. This email summarises our findings and sets out a practical plan for updating the agreement.

We have kept in mind your three strategic objectives:

1. **Preparing for a future business sale** – ensuring the agreement is assignable and attractive to a buyer
2. **Flexibility on charging structure and fees** – giving you room to adjust pricing as your business evolves
3. **Moving to online terms and conditions** – transitioning from paper contracts to a self-service model

## Overall Assessment

**The good news**: Your Hosting Agreement is well-drafted and broadly fit for purpose. It contains strong liability protections, comprehensive data protection provisions and sensible operational clauses. For a low-value SaaS subscription, it does the job well.

**The areas for improvement**: When compared against modern market-standard terms, there are gaps in commercial protection mechanisms—particularly around pricing and exit provisions—that could erode your position over time. Critically for your objectives, the agreement currently lacks an express right for you to assign the contract (important for any sale) and the fixed pricing structure limits your flexibility. The paper-based format also needs updating if you want to move to online sign-up.

**Our recommendation**: With targeted amendments addressing the priority issues below, this would be a robust template suitable for online deployment and attractive to a future purchaser of the business.

## Key Strengths (No Changes Needed)

Your agreement already handles these areas well:

- **Liability cap** – 125% of annual fees is reasonable and the carve-outs are appropriate
- **Data protection** – Clause 8 is comprehensive and covers Article 28 processor obligations
- **Security acknowledgements** – Clauses 8.6-8.7 sensibly allocate security responsibility to the customer
- **Acceptance testing** – Clause 4 protects against post-deployment claims
- **Warranties** – Time-limited with exclusive remedies
- **Termination rights** – Clear triggers including customer discontinuation
- **Dispute resolution** – Tiered approach with expert determination for technical issues

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Address Before Next Customer Sign-up)

**1. Add a price escalation clause** *(supports charging flexibility)*

*The issue*: Your fees are fixed with no annual review mechanism. Over multi-year relationships, inflation will erode your revenue in real terms. More importantly, this limits your ability to adjust your charging structure as the business grows.

*The fix*: Add a new clause allowing you to increase fees on each anniversary with 60 days' notice. This is standard market practice and gives you flexibility to evolve your pricing model.

*Suggested wording*:
> "Lamplight may increase the Fees on each anniversary of the Commencement Date upon giving the Customer not less than 60 days' prior written notice."

---

**2. Add a data return mechanism**

*The issue*: Your agreement addresses data deletion (28 days post-termination) but not data return. Without a time limit, customers could demand their data back months or years after termination, with no right for you to recover costs.

*The fix*: Add a clause giving customers 14 days to request data return, after which you may delete. Make return subject to payment of outstanding fees and extraction costs.

*Suggested wording*:
> "Following termination, the Customer may request return of Customer Data by written notice within 14 days of termination. Subject to payment of all outstanding Fees and Lamplight's reasonable costs of extraction, Lamplight shall deliver the data within 30 days. If no request is received within 14 days, Lamplight may delete the data."

---

### Medium Priority (Address in Next Template Update)

**3. Update "writing" definition to include email**

Your current definition explicitly excludes email. This is outdated and means termination notices sent by email may not be effective. Change Clause 1.7 to: *"A reference to writing or written includes email."*

---

**4. Add a notices clause**

Your agreement has no formal notices clause setting out addresses and deemed receipt rules. This creates uncertainty about when notices take effect. We can provide standard wording.

---

**5. Update GDPR references to UK GDPR**

Your definitions reference EU GDPR and the EEA. Post-Brexit, these should refer to UK GDPR (as defined in the DPA 2018) and the United Kingdom. This is a technical correction but avoids ambiguity.

---

**6. Add licence restrictions**

Your agreement lacks express prohibitions on reverse engineering, competitive use and sublicensing. These are standard in SaaS terms and worth adding.

---

**7. Add express supplier assignment right** *(critical for business sale)*

Your agreement requires customer consent for assignment but is silent on your own right to assign. **This is a significant issue if you are considering selling the business.** A buyer will want certainty that customer contracts transfer automatically on completion. Add a clause confirming Lamplight can assign without consent.

---

### Transition to Online Terms *(supports self-service model)*

Your current agreement is structured as a paper contract with signature blocks. To move to an online self-service model, we would need to:

- Restructure as "Terms and Conditions" that customers accept by clicking through or by using the service
- Add an order form or online sign-up process that captures customer details and selected services
- Include deemed acceptance language (e.g. "By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms")
- Consider adding a trial period mechanism if you offer free trials

This is best addressed as part of Phase 2, and we can discuss the commercial flow you want to implement.

---

### Nice-to-Have (Consider for Completeness)

- Clarify IP indemnity as "sole and exclusive remedy"
- Add clause confirming you own all improvements/enhancements
- Add 5-year survival period for confidentiality obligations

---

## Practical Plan

We suggest addressing these updates in two phases:

**Phase 1: Immediate (before next customer sign-up)**
- Add price escalation clause
- Add data return mechanism
- Update "writing" definition

*Estimated time*: 1-2 hours of drafting

**Phase 2: Template refresh and online transition (within next quarter)**
- Add notices clause
- Update GDPR references throughout
- Add licence restrictions
- Add supplier assignment right
- Restructure for online/click-wrap acceptance
- Consider nice-to-have items

*Estimated time*: 4-6 hours of drafting, plus your review

---

## What We Need From You

1. **Confirmation of approach** – Are you happy for us to proceed with Phase 1 immediately?

2. **Commercial input on price escalation** – Do you want to specify a cap (e.g. "not exceeding RPI + 3%") or leave it at your discretion with notice?

3. **Data return costs** – Do you have a standard charge for data extraction, or should we leave this as "reasonable costs"?

4. **Online sign-up process** – How do customers currently sign up? Do you have an existing website or portal where terms would be displayed? This will help us structure the online format appropriately.

5. **Timeline for Phase 2** – When would you like us to deliver the full template refresh and online version?

---

## Next Steps

Once you confirm the above, we will:

1. Prepare the Phase 1 amendments as a short addendum or tracked changes to the main agreement
2. Provide updated template for your review
3. Schedule Phase 2 work as agreed

Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of these points.

Kind regards,
