# DRAFTING NOTES FOR Systems integration agreement (pro-supplier)

by

Standard documents | Maintained | United Kingdom

A standard document providing a pro-supplier framework for a systems integration agreement. This document is designed for projects involving the acquisition, development, and integration of both hardware and software to create a complete computer system for a customer. It sets out the supplier’s obligations for delivering hardware, software (including bespoke, modified, and third-party software), and related professional services such as installation and integration. Provisions address project management, a structured process for pre-installation and acceptance testing, and a detailed change control procedure for managing variations. This document grants the customer a non-exclusive software licence while ensuring that intellectual property rights are retained by the supplier. It also includes supplier-favourable clauses on warranties, an intellectual property rights indemnity, and a limitation of liability, alongside considerations for data protection, confidentiality, and cybersecurity obligations.

About this document
 
Systems integration agreements are contracts for the acquisition, development and integration of the hardware and software necessary to produce (in conjunction with the customer’s business data) an entire computer system.
 
There are several types of systems integration agreement:
 
 without any software development.
Turnkey with some software development.
An agreement for the assembly of components that have been purchased separately by the customer.
An agreement for the integration of components that have been purchased separately by the customer, including some software modification or development.
An agreement for the integration of new components with the customer’s existing system, which usually involves some software modification or development.
Within these types, individual agreements will vary widely depending on the system, the customer’s business and the use to which the system is put. An agreement for a new air traffic control system, for example, will have to deal with very different issues to those in an agreement for an upgraded payroll-account system. Indeed, there will be significant differences between agreements to upgrade the payroll-accounts system of a multinational company and those of a small, local firm.
 
However, several features suitable for larger deals have been incorporated as options. These include provision for country-specific amendments, extension of the benefit of software and services to affiliates and various measures to increase supplier’s liability under the agreement. Some generic concepts such as affiliates, control and VAT/sales tax have also been included as alternatives to the UK-focused equivalents.
 
Other features of the standard document include:
 
Data protection.
Data security breach.
Restoration of lost or corrupted data.
Ownership of data.
Provisions relating to international technology export control.
The standard document illustrates the basic issues that need to be considered in all systems integration agreements that include some software modification or development. The development and modification of software are usually the hardest parts of the project to deal with in the agreement, and the most usual cause of disputes between suppliers and customers.
 
The standard document is generally drafted from the perspective of the supplier. However, both parties should regard it as being in their own interest to negotiate an agreement which is fairly balanced, as this will make the project more likely to proceed smoothly with few disputes. A party who feels that it has been forced into a bad bargain by the negotiating strength and leverage of the other party is more likely to be looking for a way out if things go wrong. There are almost always implementation problems when software development or integration is involved.
 
For more information on the issues that arise in the negotiation of systems integration agreements, see .
 
 
Assumptions
 
This standard document is drafted on the following assumptions:
 
The supplier and the customer are private companies incorporated in England and Wales.
The supplier and the customer are limited companies, the agreement will be performed in the UK and the output from the agreement will be used in the UK.
The agreement is subject to English law.
No employees are intended to transfer as part of the systems integration project, and the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/246) (TUPE) do not apply. If there is a risk that TUPE applies, then this should be considered carefully and the agreement amended to reflect the risk. see  For more information on when TUPE may apply to service provision changes, as well as pro-supplier drafting to address the risks of TUPE applying on entry, see .
NIS 2 and DORA do not apply to the transaction contemplated by this template, see .
This template does not contain specific drafting to address considerations relating to AI. For more information on issues to consider and some possible drafting solutions (provided by the Society for Computers and Law), see ,  and .
These standards terms assume that the only services being provided by the supplier are limited to those services set out in , namely maintenance and support, training, consultancy and disaster recovery / business continuity. In particular, it is assumed that the end system will be hosted and operated locally in the UK by the customer after being provided “Ready for Service” by the supplier. If the supplier is providing additional services, for example software as a service, or system hosting, then further service terms should be considered. For more information, see .
  
Legal issues
 
 
Intellectual property rights
 
Software is protected by intellectual property rights (IPRs), namely copyright, and, in some cases, patents as well (see ). This means that IPR issues must potentially be considered for three kinds of software in a systems integration agreement:
 
Pre-existing software used without modification.
Pre-existing software which is to be modified.
New software which is to be developed for the customer.
 
Licence of IPRs
 
Each party should carry out due diligence before entering into the agreement. They should find out what the IPR position is, and in particular, what licences are necessary for the project to go ahead and the effect of the existing contractual terms under the local law applicable to where the services are to be provided. The supplier should also seek to establish what it needs to provide the services, particularly in terms of licences from the customer, third-party licences and its own software.
 
In order to use pre-existing software, the customer needs a licence from the owner of the rights in the software (or from someone who has been granted rights to sub-license the software by the owner). Copyright is infringed by a number of acts, including the unauthorised copying of the copyright work. Since the mere act of loading software into a computer involves copying it onto its memory, a licence is required even for the most basic use of a computer program. If there is a patent, the use of software that is covered by any valid claim of that patent will also be patent infringement unless it is made under a licence. The precise scope of the licence is, however, a matter for negotiation between the parties (see ).
 
Making a derivative work can also be an infringement of copyright and, if it comes within a claim of the patent, patent infringement. Standard software licences almost always exclude, to the extent legally possible, the right to modify the software. While UK law does give a right to  software in order to obtain information that is needed to make that program operate with another independent program, that only relates to copyright. In any event it would be unwise to rely on that right as it is limited and untested in the courts (see ). To avoid liability for infringement, therefore, the supplier must get the rights-owner’s permission for pre-existing software to be modified for use in the customer’s system.
 
Ownership of IPRs
 
The issue of ownership of the rights in any newly developed software is usually difficult to resolve. Unless specified to the contrary in the agreement, the default statutory position is that the supplier will own these. The customer often takes the position that, having paid for the software to be developed, it wants to own the rights in it. However, software is very rarely written from scratch; it is usually constructed using existing modules which the software developer has developed in previous projects and which it will want to use again for other customers. This means that the supplier will not usually agree to transfer ownership of all rights.
 
There are a number of approaches to giving each party what it needs:
 
If the customer’s main concern is that it does not want software that it has paid for to be sold to a competitor, the supplier could offer an exclusive licence to use the program as a whole, but only a non-exclusive licence to use the standard modules embedded in the program. If the supplier then wanted to re-use all or a significant part of the program at a later date, it could offer the customer a reduction in the original price or a payment for each further copy sold in return for an agreement to allow the program to be resold.
If the customer wants to be able to maintain the software itself, it could be given a copy of the source code and a licence which covers maintenance.
In the unusual case where the customer wants to commercially exploit the software itself, it could be given wide rights to sub-license. The customer should seek to have these rights free from restrictions, although the supplier should seek to exert some control over such sub-licensing, which could otherwise damage its business.
See .
 
IPR Indemnity
 
It would be impractical for the customer to verify the supplier’s claims of ownership of the software and of the right to license its use. Accordingly, the customer will want to ensure that it is contractually protected if the supplier is not, in fact, so entitled. This protection is necessary in case the IPRs in all or part of the software actually belong to someone else, and the licensor has not given the supplier the right to grant sub-licences. This may happen even where the software was written by the supplier, for example, in cases where it has transferred the IPRs in the software to a previous customer. It can also be relevant if, in writing the software, an employee of the supplier copied code from a pre-existing program belonging to a third party. In those situations, use of the software by the customer would constitute a breach of the third-party IPRs in the software and would expose the customer to the risk of an infringement action.
 
It is therefore usual for the supplier to provide some protection for the customer against claims that the software infringes any third-party IPRs, commonly in the form of a contractual indemnity (see ). This may be subject to a capped amount and should exclude infringement caused by the customer’s own activities (see ). The customer will often contend that the supplier should remain liable for infringements arising from use of the software or hardware it supplies in conjunction with other software or hardware which it knew was required to implement and use the system, for example, the operating system or standard database software.
 
For more information, see .
 
Warranties
 
There is uncertainty as to whether a contract for the provision of bespoke software is legally classified as a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for the provision of services, although the tax authorities have their own tests. In the case of systems integration agreements, the classification may depend on the ratio of the value of goods (standard software) to services (modifications, bespoke software and integration) in the contract. The draftsperson needs to keep in mind the provisions of legislation and case law relating to both types of contract, particularly in the area of  and limitation of liability.
 
Systems integration agreements typically include warranties relating to the supplier’s rights to license the software (see above). The customer will usually seek warranties as to the performance of the system, so as to ensure that there are legal remedies available to it if there are serious problems with the system’s performance. The supplier should not in general offer such warranties, and, if they are required as part of the negotiated agreement, they should be tied strictly to demonstrable performance standards, which should be contained in an agreed technical specification (see ). This is not necessarily bad for the customer, as it results in standards of performance that can readily be measured, and failure to meet those standards will be much easier to prove in a dispute.
 
For more information, see .
 
Limitation of liability
 
See .
 
Reliance and entire agreement clause
 
The customer may seek to recite specifically in the agreement its reliance on representations made in the supplier’s response to the customer’s invitation to tender. Suppliers should always resist a general recital of reliance and the most they will usually agree to is having the specific representations the customer says it relied on incorporated into the contract. If they are not so incorporated, the aim of the entire agreement clause is to exclude representations not in this agreement, so they cannot be relied on in a later dispute.
 
For more information, see  and .
 
WEEE Regulations and product standards and labelling
 
Producers (manufacturers, resellers, sellers and importers) of new electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) should be aware that, under the  they are obliged to finance the collection, treatment recovery and environmentally sound disposal of waste EEE (WEEE) by joining an approved producer compliance scheme (PCS). Larger distributors (retailers) also have take-back requirements to collect very small WEEE in their retail areas to return to the producers. Producers must also mark all new EEE in such a manner that they can be easily identified as its producer, and that the equipment can be readily identified as having been put on the market. Producers must also mark all new EEE with a crossed-out wheelie bin symbol (indicating it should not be disposed of as part of unsorted municipal waste).
 
For more information, see .
 
In addition, from 1 January 2021, UK conformity assessments in respect of CE markings will no longer be valid in the EU and UK businesses selling into the EU will need to obtain new EU-issued certificates or transfer existing UK certificates to an EU-based assessor. The UK will introduce a UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark for products that require third party assessment of conformity within the UK. The CE and UKCA markings will both be valid in the UK for a currently undefined period of time, after which only the UKCA mark will be accepted on UK products. After the end of the , UK manufacturers exporting products to the EU will need to appoint an importer and EU products destined for the UK market will require a UK importer. For more information, see .
 
Bribery Act 2010
 
The  (BA 2010) came into force on 1 July 2011. It replaces the existing criminal offences of bribery, and also introduces new offences. It sets out:
 
The offence of bribing another person (, BA 2010).
The offences relating to being bribed (, BA 2010).
The offence of bribing a foreign public official (, BA 2010).
The offence of failure of commercial organisations to prevent bribery (, BA 2010).
Of particular concern is the section 7 corporate offence of failure to prevent bribery by an associated person. A commercial organisation (including a company or partnership) will be guilty of an offence if a person associated with it bribes another person intending to obtain or retain business for the commercial organisation, or to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for the commercial organisation (section 7, BA 2010).
 
Under the BA 2010, a person (A) is associated with a relevant commercial organisation (C) if A performs services for or on behalf of C (, BA 2010). Although the BA 2010 specifically states that A may be C’s employee, subsidiary or agent, it does not matter in what capacity A performs services for or on behalf of C. Whether or not A is a person who performs services for or on behalf of C is to be determined by reference to all the relevant circumstances, and not merely by reference to the nature of the relationship between A and C.
 
Under this definition, a supplier of services will be an associated person to its customer (the commercial organisation). As it is a customer who is at risk of committing the section 7 offence, a supplier should therefore be prepared for its customer raising the issue as part of its selection process and in negotiations:
 
A customer may ask questions about the supplier and its own anti-bribery policies as part of a due diligence exercise.
A customer may require comfort in the form of anti-bribery clauses in its agreement with the supplier. For an example, see . Practitioners acting for suppliers should review these clauses, as they reflect, broadly, typical obligations required by a customer.
Suppliers should consider creating and implementing their own anti-bribery and corruption policies (for information, see ). By implementing their own policies and procedures, a supplier can avoid the cost implications and practical difficulties in having to comply with numerous (and potentially significantly different) anti-bribery policies of all its customers. This approach will also provide comfort to a customer that it is dealing with a supplier that takes the BA 2010 seriously.
The supplier’s own policies and procedures should be annexed to their own standard form commercial agreements which fall into scope of the section 7 offence.
If amending a customer’s anti-bribery clauses to reduce their strength (for example, by making them warranties), a supplier should note that a well advised customer is very likely to reject this approach in negotiations, as it will rightly point out that it is the party who risks committing the criminal offence under section 7 of the BA 2010.
Where the arrangement includes a supply chain, so that the supplier is appointing subcontractors to perform services, a supplier will need to do appropriate anti-bribery due diligence on such subcontractors, and require the subcontractors to comply with any anti-bribery obligations imposed by a customer. For further information, see the discussion on supply chain issues in .

See ,  and .
 
Competition issues
 
Under UK competition law, a party’s refusal to license materials protected by IPRs to third parties can in certain circumstances be challenged under Chapter II of the  (Competition Act), The Chapter II prohibition is based on Article 102 of  (TFEU), and prohibits abuses of dominance in a market which may have an effect on trade within the UK or any part of it.
 
In addition, Chapter I of the Competition Act, based on Article 101 of the TFEU, prohibits anti-competitive agreements between undertakings (that is, any natural or legal person carrying on economic activities, including companies, sole traders and trading divisions of public bodies), which have the object or effect of restricting competition within the UK and which affect trade within the UK or any part of it.
 
Entering into an agreement that breaches UK competition law can result in:
 
The agreement (or particular sections of it) being null and void.
The parties being subject to investigation and enforcement proceedings by UK competition authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
Potential exposure to large fines and private actions for damages.
The EU competition rules (Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU) will continue to apply, at the end of the , to agreements or conduct of UK companies that have an effect within the EU, see .
 
At the EU level, an agreement that is caught by Article 101(1) TFEU may nevertheless escape prohibition (and therefore voidness) under Article 101(3) TFEU if it is subject to either an individual or block exemption. Block exemptions provide a safe harbour for the relevant agreement, meaning that satisfaction of the block exemption criteria will provide assurance that the agreement will not infringe competition law. Disapplication or non-satisfaction of a block exemption does not necessarily mean that an agreement will breach competition law, however it will mean the safe harbour does not apply and an individual assessment is required. Agreements that include so-called ‘hardcore restrictions’ set out in the block exemptions are likely to cause competition concern. For more information, see .
 
In the UK,  apply to agreements which are covered by an EU Commission individual or block exemption under Article 101(3) of the TFEU, or would be covered by an EU Commission block exemption if the agreement had an appreciable effect on trade between EU member states. Agreements covered by parallel exemptions are automatically exempt from the Chapter I prohibition.
 
In the licensing context,  on the application of Article 101(3) of the TFEU to categories of technology transfer agreements (the technology transfer block exemption regulation (TTBER)) is particularly relevant.
 
Under the terms of the TTBER,
 
Hardcore restrictions (Article 4) – restrictions on onward sales price, and territories. It is a hardcore restriction disapplying the block exemption for an agreement to restrict the ability of a licensee to determine prices when onward selling to third parties, and to allocate markets unless it forms part of a reserved exclusive territory. It is also a hardcore restriction to restrict the exploitation of the licencee’s own technology unless it is indispensable to prevent disclosure of licensed IP (Article 4). A hardcore restriction disapplies the block exemption and would require individual assessment for any competition concern.
Excluded restrictions (Article 5) - Grant-back of rights. It is an excluded restriction, voiding the relevant clause but not the whole agreement, to include any direct or indirect obligation to grant-back rights to improvements made by the licensee, and to include any no-challenge clause in relation to the IP.
After the end of the transition period, the EU block exemptions were adopted into UK law as “retained exemptions”, with their same expiry date, but domesticated to remove EU references. As a result, agreements that currently enjoy a safe harbour under one of these parallel block exemptions will continue to do so post-transition period.
 
Companies entering into new agreements after December 2020 will also be able to benefit from the retained exemptions, provided they meet the relevant criteria. However, companies should be aware that UK courts and authorities may be able to divert from previous EU interpretation of the block exemptions, most likely where there are material differences in UK and EU legislation or markets, even if this is initially unlikely.
 
The UK has also made adjustments to each of the retained exemptions as they come up for renewal. The UK has already published a new Vertical Agreements Block Exemption Order, Research and Development Block Exemption Order and Specialisation Agreements Block Exemption Order, and Motor Vehicles Agreements Block Exemption Order, together with updated guidelines (see ,  and . In each case the UK broadly adopted the same provisions as the EU block exemption, but made minor revisions to clarify or expand the scope in certain areas.
 
The EU Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation expires on 30 April 2026. The CMA has recommended repacing it with a new Technology Transfer Block Exemption Order, see .

Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024
The parties should consider whether they are affected by the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA) which received Royal Assent on 24 May 2024. The DMCCA provides a new digital markets regime and reforms competition law and consumer law. Apart from provisions relating to the foreign acquisition of newspapers and energy network mergers (which are already in force) the DMCCA will be brought into force by statutory instrument. The digital markets and competition aspects apply from 1 January 2025.

Supply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking
 
The  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement each financial year. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.
 
The supplier should note that the customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the supplier will comply with the customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the supplier may require the customer to comply with the supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.
 
For further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see  .
 
Data protection
 
Where  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at  or, alternatively, as part of a data protection schedule to be annexed to this agreement.
 
The clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.
 
For some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:

Each set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.

EU considerations
This standard document is drafted on the assumption that the supplier and the customer are limited companies incorporated in the UK and the services are intended for use in the UK. Where the services are used within the EU, it may also be necessary to consider compliance with any minimum cybersecurity requirements set out in current and planned EU regulations (in particular, Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (NIS 2) and Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector (DORA). For more information, see .
 
Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018
The predominant cybersecurity legislation to consider is the  (NIS Regulations) which came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the  (also known as the Network and Information Security or NIS Directive). They have potential impact on:
 
any operator of essential services (OES) in businesses that rely on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure; and
relevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).
Although the NIS Regulations do not set out prescriptive cybersecurity requirements, compliance with their terms requires appropriate and proportionate security measures to be implemented. This will depend on the cybersecurity risk which is identified. For more information, see .
 
Like the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.
 
For a definition of an OES see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .
 
OESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OES).
 
If the customer is an OES or a RDSP, the supplier’s system might be implicated in the customer’s obligations under the NIS Regulations. During systems integration work the customer and supplier systems are likely to interface with each other, particularly during the acceptance testing phase. Each party is likely to carry out a range of tests and the supplier is likely to provide a variety of online development tools for this purpose. Test data is likely to include actual personal data at some point and this is when a security breach may have significant compliance consequences for OESs and RDSPs under the NIS Regulations, as well as under any data protection legislation. The customer will want to ensure that the supplier cooperates in the event of a security incident.
 
The customer may ask for a warranty in relation to the supplier’s network security levels, and to ensure the supplier cooperates with any of the customer’s regulatory obligations. An example of the type of clause the customer might ask for is set out in clause 22 of . It may be reasonable to agree to such provisions, and in fact the supplier may have developed comprehensive processes and policies to support the services it provides. However, the supplier should in return ask for a warranty or some form of approval that the information the supplier provides is sufficient for the customer to meet its obligations under the NIS Regulations.
 
The National Cyber Security Centre has published  which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances. See also .
 
There may also be specific guidance issued by the regulator for the specific OES sector or, for RDSPs, the ICO.
 
Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022
The  (PSTIA 2022) is framework legislation only, but implementing regulations passed during 2023 bring Part 1 of the PSTIA 2022 fully into force from 29 April 2024. Obligations for in scope products include periodic security updates, password administration and vulnerability management (see  and ).
 
While in-scope products are generally limited to consumer products which can connect to the internet or other networks, and can transmit and receive digital data, with examples including smartphones, smart TVs, smart speakers, connected baby monitors and connected alarm systems, the PSTIA 2022 is also potentially relevant to software embedded in such devices, where those devices are being used for business purposes (but where identical products have also been marketed to consumers).
 
At the EU level, similar provisions apply to in-scope products with a digital element under the Cyber Resilience Act (see ).
 
The parties will need to consider whether the obligations contained in this agreement are compatible with (and do not override) any mandatory obligations that are imposed on manufacturers, importers and distributors under this legislation.
  
Negotiating and drafting issues
 
 
Bargaining power of parties
 
There are often significant differences in size and bargaining power between parties to system integration agreements. There are a few very large suppliers of IT services who have considerable experience in most of the usual types of system integration projects. They tend to have standard terms which are favourable to them and refuse to make any significant changes except for very large customers, such as national governments. On the other hand, there are small specialised supplier firms who have to deal with customers who are much more powerful than them. For example, such firms with expertise in very sophisticated financial software may be negotiating with large and powerful banks and financial institutions. In practice, it is not in the long-term interest of the more powerful party to insist on a one-sided contract, as this tends to lead to disputes. Another risk of this approach is that, where the contract is obviously unfair, the courts are more likely to apply  and other legal principles in favour of the weaker party.
 
Escrow agreement
 
The customer may ask for a source code escrow arrangement, particularly when software has been specially developed or modified. This is a means of ensuring that the customer will be able to continue to support the software, either itself or through a third-party maintainer, if the supplier fails to do so adequately or at all. While this situation may arise due to insolvency, the customer may insist that this is not the only trigger for release of the escrowed code, as suppliers who are in financial trouble tend to provide inadequate maintenance long before they become officially insolvent.
 
It is normal in systems integrations where there has been software development or modification for the supplier to agree to an escrow agreement. However, the supplier should ensure that the terms of the agreement:
 
Restrict access to the source code to circumstances where it is truly unwilling or unable to provide support.
Do not trigger access where there is merely a dispute over the cost of maintenance.
Where software has been specially developed or modified, the customer will probably seek to include, in the escrow deposit, supporting documentation that will help a new programmer to understand how the software operates. Where the supplier continues to provide maintenance, updates or new versions of the software, the customer is likely to request that the source code for any changes is promptly deposited with the escrow agent.
 
For more information, see  and .
 
If acting for the customer, see also  relating to .
 
Structure and content of agreement
 
The standard document covers all types of software supply, including:
 
Standard software owned by the supplier or third parties which is to be used without modifications.
Standard software to be modified for use by the customer.
Software specially developed for the customer.
Modifications to the standard document may be required, depending on what the supplier is providing.
 
For the supplier who is also going to provide maintenance of all or part of the system, a simple set of maintenance provisions is to be found in . If these provisions suffice, then  and  should be deleted. Where more complicated terms are required (for example, where the software is critical to the customer’s business and more detailed response time requirements are needed), it may be advisable to put the maintenance provisions in a separate, but annexed, contract. If the supplier is not going to provide such services under the agreement, then:
 
Remove .
Delete the definitions of , , , ,  and .
Amend  accordingly.
Attach the maintenance and support agreement as .
In addition, the task of preparing the agreement is made simpler if all the variables are put into schedules or appendices so that the main text of the agreement can used for each customer without having to be amended. In addition to the contractual terms and conditions, there will normally be:
 
A functional specification (defined as Business Requirements Specification), setting out what the software is to do and the business requirements it must fulfil.
An acceptance testing procedure.
A project implementation plan, including a timetable.
In addition, there may be one or more of the following:
 
A technical specification of the software.
A change control procedure (if this is not dealt with in the body of the agreement).
A dispute resolution procedure or arbitration procedure, if this is not dealt with in the body of the agreement.
A specification of the documentation to be provided.
A specification of additional services (such as training, business continuity and disaster recovery) that are to be provided.
A payments schedule.
A contract for ongoing maintenance of all or part of the software, although (as in the standard document) if the arrangement is simple, this may also be dealt with in the agreement itself.
One or more source code escrow agreements.
A copy of the customer’s invitation to tender and the supplier’s proposal. These two documents are not referred to in the standard document as the supplier should not offer to include them, but the customer may insist that they should form part of the agreement (see ). If they are to be included they should be added as an annex, and it is vital to ensure that they are properly incorporated by reference into the agreement. The parties must also ensure that any potential conflict between the provisions of these documents is dealt with by specifying an order of precedence between them. Their place in that order will have to be negotiated. The supplier should resist having its proposal given a higher ranking than the express terms of the agreement, as this could lead to it being held contractually to statements made at an early stage, relying solely on the customer’s tender documents.
 
Schedules and annexes
 
System integration agreements typically have several schedules, which will contain details of matters and items that are to be provided under the agreement, and anything else that is to be included. The contract is more manageable if these details are in separate schedules at the end of the agreement rather than being set out in the body of the agreement, but the agreement must make it clear that these are contractual terms and conditions. It should also provide for possible conflicts between these documents (see Drafting note, Structure and content of agreement).
 
Where there are related agreements, for example, the software licence and maintenance agreement, they should be annexed to the main agreement. Annexation means that the agreements will be interpreted as related agreements. It also has the practical benefit of keeping all the agreements readily to hand in one place. The customer may assert that it is relying on representations made by the supplier in the response to the invitation to tender, in which case it will want to have these documents annexed to the main agreement. The supplier should strongly resist this, and may offer instead to incorporate in the agreement those specific representations the customer wants to rely on (see  and ).
 
Drafting for environmental sustainability
 
The  (TCLP) brings together legal professionals to create model climate clauses that lawyers, businesses and governments can use in commercial contracts and transactions to help fight climate change and support the move towards achieving net zero. TCLP is independent of any professional body or practice and is politically neutral. It has published  which may be integrated into this agreement to allow the parties to adjust their obligations so as to become “lower carbon”, and/or to require their counterparty to do the same.
 
Other model clauses are freely available for incorporation into law firm precedents and commercial agreements.

PARTIES

Parties
 
The supplier should check that the correct corporate entity is identified as the Customer. If one company contracts on behalf of other members of its group, the supplier should require proof that the contracting company has sufficient control over the other users to ensure that they will comply with the terms and conditions in the agreement (particularly those relating to use of the system and confidential information), otherwise those users should also be made party to the agreement.

AGREED TERMS

1.  INTERPRETATION

Interpretation
 
See .

The definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in this agreement.

1.1  Definitions:

Acceptance Certificate:  the certificate to be signed by the Customer under .

Acceptance Date:  the date on which the Acceptance Certificate is issued by the Customer under .

Acceptance Tests:  the tests of the system after installation to be agreed in accordance with  and annexed as .

Actual Hardware Delivery Date: the date on which the Supplier delivers the relevant item of Supplier Hardware to the Site(s).:

Actual Installation Date:  the date by which the Supplier completes installation of the relevant item of Hardware or a Software Module.

Actual Software Delivery Date: the:  date on which the Supplier delivers the relevant Software Module to the Site(s).

Affiliate:  any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity.

Affiliate
 
This generic definition may appeal to those less familiar with UK law more than definitions reliant on statutory provisions. However, UK statutory definitions may be used as an alternative, specifically “subsidiary” and “subsidiary undertaking” under  and  of the . A subsidiary undertaking is defined much more widely than a subsidiary. (See .)

Bespoke Software:  any software programs developed by the Supplier specifically for the Customer as part of the System and listed in .

Business:  the business of the Customer as specified in .

Business
 
The agreement limits the customer to using the system in a specific business. This limitation is necessary to protect the supplier where the customer is a large organisation. The supplier will not want the customer to pay for a system for one of its businesses and then use the system for different businesses without further payment.

Business Day:  a day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in England, when banks in London are open for business.

Business Hours:  the period from [9.00 am to 5.00 pm] on any Business Day.

Business Requirements Specification:  the specification agreed between the Customer and the Supplier which sets out the Customer’s business requirements regarding the System, contained in .

Business Requirements Specification
 
The business requirements specification will be prepared by the customer, or by a consultant on the customer’s behalf, usually as one of the documents given to prospective suppliers during the tendering process.
 
Except for very simple systems, the supplier is advised to produce a technical specification, which will set out the measurable deliverables and performance criteria that are necessary to achieve the business requirements. The supplier should also obtain the customer’s written agreement that this technical specification meets their specified business requirements. This agreed technical specification will then act as the yardstick against which performance of the supplier’s obligations is measured. If the supplier cuts corners by failing to prepare a proper technical specification, or agrees to have its performance measured against the customer’s business requirements specification, it may find that, while the system is developed, it is trying to hit a vague or moving target, with ample scope for disagreement as to whether the requirements have been met. Having an accurate and detailed technical specification reduces the chance of disagreements over whether or not the supplier has met its obligations.
 
The technical specification is both technical and legal in nature. Accordingly, irrespective of who prepares it, it should be reviewed from a legal point of view as soon as it is feasible to do so. It is a crucial part of the agreement and its success depends on its technical accuracy and completeness.
 
Understanding the role of each document is important. The supplier will want the technical specification to be comprehensive and, once it has been finalised, for the business requirements specification to be deemed no longer relevant (particularly as it may be a source of argument under the dispute resolution procedure). However, the customer will want it to retained as it sets out the customer’s core requirements and the customer may not have had the time to come to grips fully with the technical specification (usually, as mentioned, prepared by the supplier).
 
For more information, see and .

Change Agreement:  an agreement made under .

Commencement Date:  the date on which this agreement becomes effective, as specified in .

Completion Date:  the estimated date specified in the Implementation Plan (which may be varied in accordance with ) by which the Supplier is to provide the System Ready for Service.

Computer Hardware:  the computer hardware used by the Customer to operate the Licensed Software.

Confidential Information:  has the meaning set out in .

[Contract Year:  any 12-month period ending on any anniversary of the Commencement Date.]

Control:  [shall be as defined in section 1124 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, and the expression change of control shall be interpreted accordingly OR the beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of a company or the legal power to direct or cause the direction of the general management of the company, and controls, controlled and the expression change of control shall be interpreted accordingly.]

Control
 
This concept is relevant to the definition of Affiliate (which may be used in reference to either party), and to clause 34.4(a) regarding termination. The appropriate percentage should be inserted (50% is typical). Identify the provisions in your agreement in which references to affiliate will be used and consider whether the interests of the supplier are best served by having a broad or narrow definition in each particular case. It may be necessary to have two (or more) definitions for use in various provisions.

Customer Hardware:  all the computers and other equipment to be supplied by the Customer as set out in .

Customer Representative:  a person duly authorised by the Customer to act on its behalf for the purposes of this agreement and identified to the Supplier by written notice from the Customer.

Customer Software:  the software programs to be supplied by the Customer as specified in .

[Cybersecurity Laws:  all applicable laws, regulations, codes, guidance (from regulatory and advisory bodies, whether mandatory or not), international and national standards, [industry schemes] and sanctions relating to security of network and information systems and security breach and incident reporting requirements, including the Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018 (SI 506/2018), all as amended or updated from time to time.]

Cybersecurity Laws (optional)
 
See .

Defect:  an error in the Supported Software that causes it to fail to operate substantially in accordance with the relevant Documentation.

Defect
 
This definition is relevant to the supplier’s and customer’s obligations under clauses 21 and 25 respectively. It is important to tie it to something that can be measured objectively so that there is a standard against which the supplier’s obligations can be measured. Specifying the documentation, as in the standard document, will require the supplier to ensure that the documentation is precise, complete and up to date, but such clarity will be mutually advantageous. The “substantially” limitation in the definition does introduce some uncertainty, but without it the supplier would be obliged to fix all faults, however trivial. A trivial fault could be difficult and expensive to fix, and might not even affect the customer’s use of the system.

Dispute Resolution Procedure:  the procedure for dealing with disputes under this agreement as set out in .

Documentation:  the operating manuals, user instruction manuals, technical literature and all other related materials in human-readable and/or machine-readable forms supplied by the Supplier as specified in .

Documentation
 
The documentation that the supplier must provide is defined in terms of a list of documents (specified in Part 5 of Schedule 1). This approach is preferable for the supplier, as it gives greater certainty than a functional specification.

Good Industry Practice:  the exercise of that degree of skill, care, prudence, efficiency, foresight and timeliness as would be expected from a leading company within the relevant industry or business sector.

Hardware:  the Customer Hardware and the Supplier Hardware.

Hardware Delivery Date:  the estimated delivery date specified in the Implementation Plan, on which the Supplier will deliver an item of Supplier Hardware to the Site.

Hardware Installation Tests:  the tests set out in the Hardware Installation Test Plan to be inserted in .

Implementation Plan:  the time schedule and sequence of events for the performance of this agreement set out in , which may be varied in accordance with .

Implementation Plan
 
The supplier will initially prepare this important document, which sets out the timetable for each stage of the project, as part of the tender documents. A version agreed by both parties should be in existence and annexed to the agreement by the time the contract is signed. For more information, see .

Installation Date:  the estimated date by which the Supplier will complete installation of a specified item of Hardware or a Software Module as specified in the Implementation Plan.

Intellectual Property Rights:  [patents, utility models, rights to inventions, copyright and neighbouring and related rights, trade marks and service marks, business names and domain names, rights in get-up and trade dress, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off or unfair competition, rights in designs, database rights, rights to use, and protect the confidentiality of, confidential information (including know-how and trade secrets), and all other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications and rights to apply for and be granted, renewals or extensions of, and rights to claim priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.

Licence:  the licence granted under .

Licensed Software:  the Supplier Software as specified in  (except the Third-Party Software and Modified Software (Third-Party)) and all subsequent amendments and updates to such software (including by way of the New Releases) as may be provided under this agreement.

Licensed Software
 
Third-party-owned standard (or modified) software is excluded from this definition because it is envisaged that it will be licensed under the third party’s standard licence terms.

Licensed Users:  the employees and agents of the Customer who use the Licensed Software, up to the maximum number specified in .

Licensed Users
 
This provision is also intended to protect the supplier who is dealing with a large customer. It provides for a maximum number of users, which can only be increased on payment of an appropriate fee (see ).

[Maintenance Agreement:  the form of maintenance agreement for the Supplier Software as annexed to this agreement as .]

[Mandatory Policies:  the [Customer’s OR Supplier’s] business policies [and codes] [attached OR listed] in Schedule 6, as amended by notification to the [Supplier OR Customer] from time to time.]

Mandatory Policies
 
This definition relates to the optional compliance requirement at  which offers two drafting options. The first is a requirement on the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies, and the second is a requirement on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. Ensure that this definition is consistent with the approach taken in clause 28.3.
 
See further the integrated drafting notes at  and also  above.

Manufacturers’ Warranties:  the warranties given by any third-party manufacturer in relation to any item of the Supplier Hardware.

Modified Software:  the standard software programs proprietary to the Supplier and/or third parties listed in , modified or to be modified by the Supplier under this agreement for inclusion in the System.

Modified Software (Supplier):  those elements of the Modified Software listed in  and identified as such.

Modified Software (Third Party):  those elements of the Modified Software listed in  and identified as such.

New Release: a new release of all or any part of the Supported Software suitable for use by the Customer in which previously identified faults have been remedied or to which any modification, enhancement, revision or update has been made but which does not constitute a New Version.

New Version:  any new version of the Supplier Software, being a version released by the Supplier after the Acceptance Date which contains such significant differences from the previous versions as to be generally accepted in the marketplace as constituting a new product.

New Release and New Version
 
Support services usually include provision of new releases or updates to the software, either to correct defects or to add new functionality. The standard document distinguishes between new releases and new versions, a separate fee being paid for the latter but not the former. The customer is not obliged to take any new version ().

Normal Working Hours:  the hours [TIME] am to [TIME] pm GMT Monday to Friday, except English Bank Holidays.

Open-Source Software:  any software licensed under any form of open-source licence meeting the Open Source Initiative’s definition from time to time, which is included or used in, or in the development of, the Supplier Software or with which the Supplier Software is compiled or to which it is linked.

Open-Source Software
 
This term is used in  under which the supplier disclaims responsibility for any open-source software or any third-party licence relating to any open-source software.
 
For more detail on the Open Source Initiative’s definition, see Open Source Initiative: The Open Source Definition.

Permitted Purposes:  the meaning given in .

Site(s)
 
This provision is relevant to large customers who operate at more than one site. It can be omitted where the customer has only one site, or where the supplier agrees that the customer can use the system at multiple sites. Where there is a site limitation, it is reasonable to give the customer the ability to use the system elsewhere on a temporary basis when the business is moved to another site, or the specified site becomes unusable for some reason (see ).

Software Delivery Date:  the estimated delivery date specified in the Implementation Plan on which the Supplier will deliver a Software Module to the Site(s).

Supplier Software:  the Supplier Standard Software, the Third-Party Software, the Modified Software, the Open-Source Software, the Tools and the Bespoke Software. References to Supplier Software in this agreement shall be taken to include as it is updated from time to time by a New Release.

Supplier Software
 
The categories of software to be supplied are defined here, while the specific programs to be supplied are listed in Schedule 1. The totality of what the supplier is to provide is defined as Supplier Software. This will need to be amended to accord with the types of software that are to be supplied for the particular project. The standard document lists all possible types. If any are not to be provided under the contract, those parts should be deleted. (Corresponding deletions will also need to be made, for example, within the definition of Pre-Installation Tests.)

Supplier Standard Software:  the software programs proprietary to the Supplier, listed in , which are to be provided to the Customer without modification.

Support Charges:  the annual support charge as specified in .

Support Commencement Date:  the Acceptance Date or such other date as may be specified in .

For information on interpretation clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

[Training:  the training as specified in , to be provided by the Supplier as part of the Services.]

VAT:  value added tax imposed by the Value Added Tax Act 1994. [or any equivalent similar tax] chargeable in the UK [or elsewhere].

VAT
 
Unless the parties are confident there will be no UK VAT or equivalent sales tax, we recommend retaining the wording “or elsewhere” in the document.

Virus:  any thing or device (including any software, code, file or programme) which may:

**a.** prevent, impair or otherwise adversely affect the operation of any computer software, hardware or network, any telecommunications service, equipment or network or any other service or device;

   1.6  A reference to a statute or statutory provision includes all subordinate legislation made [from time to time OR as at the date of this agreement] under that statute or statutory provision.

   1.7  Except where a contrary intention appears, a reference to a clause, schedule or annex is a reference to a clause of, or schedule or annex to, this agreement.

   1.8  Clause and schedule headings do not affect the interpretation of this agreement.

   1.9  Writing or written excludes fax [and email OR but not email].

   1.10  The schedules to this agreement, together with any documents referred to in them, form an integral part of this agreement and any reference to this agreement means this agreement together with the schedules and all documents referred to in them, and such amendments in writing as may subsequently be agreed between the parties.

It is envisaged that  would in turn refer to various individual country addenda. Examples of such amendments include:
 
Dispute resolution procedures.
Invoicing.
Tax requirements.
Insurance.
Contact details.
 governs which provisions prevail if there is any inconsistency between the main body of the document and the relevant addendum forming part of , or between that schedule and one of the other schedules.

   3.  HARDWARE PRODUCTS TO BE PROVIDED

   Hardware supply conditions: sub-clauses 3, 5, 6 and 7
 
These will only be required where the supplier is providing at least some of the hardware for the system. This could be its own products or those of a third-party manufacturer.

   3.1  The Supplier shall supply all items of Supplier Hardware, together with all related documentation provided by third-party manufacturers of items of Supplier Hardware.

   3.2  The Customer shall provide all cabling and other equipment needed for the installation of the Supplier Hardware at the Site(s), including any equipment needed to connect and interface Supplier Hardware with Customer Hardware.

   3.3  [For those items of Supplier Hardware manufactured by the Supplier, the Supplier undertakes to make spare parts available to the Customer at the Supplier’s standard list price for at least [NUMBER] years from the Acceptance Date. For those items of Supplier Hardware manufactured by third parties, the Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to get a similar undertaking from such third-party manufacturers and will, in any event, provide the Customer with contact details for those entities known to the Supplier which provide spare parts for the items manufactured by such third parties.]

   Hardware products to be provided
 
The provision of cabling under  could be done by either the supplier or the customer, but responsibility must be agreed.
 
The agreement to make spare parts available in  is only necessary where the equipment is not standard computer equipment, so that spare parts are unlikely to be readily available.

   4.  SYSTEM CHANGES AND TECHNOLOGY SUBSTITUTION

   System changes and technology substitution
 
Where the project is major, extending over a year or more, it is possible that improved hardware will become available before the full system is installed. In these circumstances, the customer should be given the opportunity to opt for the substitution of such improved items for those originally specified.

   4.1  The Customer may request changes to the Supplier Hardware in accordance with the procedures set out in .

   4.2  The Supplier undertakes to offer to the Customer, and the Customer may at any time before the relevant Hardware Delivery Date or Software Delivery Date, and at its sole discretion, choose to obtain from the Supplier, any item of hardware or software in substitution for any corresponding item of the System where the substitute item contains new technology or has better performance characteristics than such item of the System. As part of the offer, the Supplier shall notify the Customer of any change in the Price which would result from such substitution. If the Customer chooses to obtain any such substitute item, the parties shall use best endeavours to agree and execute a Change Agreement in accordance with .

   5.  HARDWARE DELIVERY AND DELAYS

   5.1  Subject to , the Supplier shall [use its reasonable endeavours to] deliver the items of Supplier Hardware to the Site(s) by the applicable Hardware Delivery Dates.

   Delivery obligations
 
The supplier may prefer to caveat its delivery obligations in this agreement to reasonable endeavours only, although the customer may well resist this. The meaning of best endeavours, reasonable endeavours and other common forms of endeavours clauses is reviewed in .

   5.2  If any delivery is delayed at the request of, or because of the acts or omissions of, the Customer, the Implementation Plan shall be amended to take account of such delay in accordance with . If the Supplier can demonstrate that the delay has resulted in an increase in cost to the Supplier of carrying out its obligations under this agreement, the Supplier may at its sole discretion increase the Price by an amount not exceeding any such demonstrable cost. The Supplier may invoice the Customer for any additional monies that become payable in this way within [30] days of demonstrating the increase in costs.

   6.  HARDWARE TESTING

   Hardware testing
 
This provision for pre-installation testing is designed to eliminate (or at least minimise) delays caused by hardware failures during the integration process, and may not be necessary if only standard third-party-manufactured computer equipment is to be supplied.

   6.1  Before delivering any item of Supplier Hardware to the Site, the Supplier shall carry out reasonable tests to ensure that such item is in operable condition and is capable of meeting the requirements of the Technical Specification once properly installed.

   6.2  Following installation of each item of Supplier Hardware, the Supplier shall carry out the Hardware Installation Tests applicable to that item and shall supply the Customer with copies of the test results.

   6.3  If any item of the Supplier Hardware fails to pass the applicable Hardware Installation Tests then the Supplier shall have [NUMBER] days in which to remedy the deficiency, and the relevant test(s) shall be repeated within a reasonable time.

   6.4  If any item of Supplier Hardware fails in some material respect to pass such repeated Hardware Installation Tests then the Customer may, by written notice to the Supplier, choose at its sole discretion to specify (without prejudice to the Customer’s other rights and remedies) a new date for carrying out further tests on the item of Supplier Hardware on the same terms and conditions as are set out in . If the item of Supplier Hardware fails such further tests then the Customer may:

   (a)  request a repeat test under this ;

   (b)  accept the item of Supplier Hardware subject to such change of acceptance criteria, amendment of the Business Requirements Specification and/or reduction in the Price as, after taking into account all the relevant circumstances, is reasonable; or

   (c)  if the Supplier is unable to correct material defects within a period of [six] months from the start of Pre-Installation Tests under , to reject the item of Supplier Hardware as not being in conformity with this agreement, in which case the Customer may terminate this agreement.

   7.  HARDWARE WARRANTIES

   Hardware Warranties
 
The supplier should be careful about warranting that the equipment is suitable for purpose unless this is linked to, and carefully delineated in, the technical specification.

   7.1  The warranties given in this  are in addition to warranties given in other parts of this agreement.

   7.2  The Supplier warrants that:

   (a)  the Supplier Hardware will be new (except where otherwise specified in ) and of satisfactory quality [and will be suitable for the purpose for which it is intended under the Business Requirements Specification, as specified in detail in the Technical Specification]; and

   (b)  as far as it is able, the Supplier will pass on to the Customer the benefits of any Manufacturers’ Warranties.

   8.  SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION

   Software and documentation
 
Software supplied or developed by the supplier under this agreement is subject to the terms of this agreement (), whereas software supplied by a third party (whether or not modified under this agreement) is subject to terms stipulated by the relevant third party ().
 
The third party’s terms will require careful review to ensure that they do not conflict with those in the agreement between the customer and the supplier.  contemplates that the customer will enter into a direct licence agreement with a third-party software owner.
 
Alternatively, the supplier may enter into a back-to-back agreement with the third-party software owner and grants a sub-licence to the customer. If so, the supplier may be content to grant the customer similar rights to those the customer has in respect of the supplier standard software. To achieve this, the definition of Licensed Software should be expanded to include third-party software.
 
 refers to the provision of documentation relating to use of the software, which may be supplied in electronic or hard-copy form, or both.

   8.1  The Supplier shall carry out the Work with reasonable diligence and despatch, and with reasonable skill and expertise, to [use its reasonable endeavours to] provide the Supplier Software [in all material respects] in accordance with the Technical Specification by the Completion Date.

   8.2  The Supplier shall provide the Third-Party Software and any Modified Software (Third Party) to the Customer [and its Affiliates] under the standard licence terms provided by the relevant third parties, copies of which shall be provided to the Customer, and the Customer agrees to be bound to the relevant third parties by such licence terms [and [to use reasonable endeavours] to ensure that its Affiliates are bound under similar obligations owed to the relevant third parties].

   8.3  The Supplier shall provide the Supplier Standard Software, the Bespoke Software and any Modified Software (Supplier) under the terms of this agreement.

   8.4  The Supplier shall develop the Bespoke Software and modify the Modified Software in accordance with the requirements of the Technical Specification [in all material respects].

   8.5  The Supplier shall provide to the Customer from time to time copies of the Documentation containing up-to-date information for the proper use [and maintenance] of the System. Such Documentation may be supplied in electronic form.

   8.6  The Customer may make such further copies of the Documentation as are reasonably necessary for the use [and maintenance] of the System [and for training the Customer’s personnel in use of the System]. The Customer shall ensure that all Supplier’s proprietary notices are reproduced in any such copy.

   9.  SERVICES

   Services
 
There is provision in Schedule 3 for details of training and disaster recovery and business continuity services (see ). If you need more comprehensive provisions, attach appropriate stand-alone pro forma agreements. Any obligation to provide disaster recovery and business continuity services (see ) typically arises where the contract services are ongoing in nature, such as maintenance and support. If greater certainty is required regarding these terms, consider attaching a pro forma agreement as an appendix to this agreement, using a similar approach to that adopted for maintenance and support.
 
It is good drafting practice to place all the supplier’s principal obligations together in the agreement, as this makes it easier to check that everything has been addressed to the supplier’s satisfaction.
 
The supplier should try to tie its obligations to modify and develop software (,  and ) to the requirements of the technical specification, which will normally include more precise definitions of the functions such software is to perform (and of any performance criteria) than the business requirements’ specification will contain.
 
The obligations to provide the system and associated services are expressed simply as acts (see  and ), completion of which it should be simple to demonstrate. The supplier should resist having these obligations tied to satisfactory outcomes of these acts described in general terms, which would be the preferred drafting from the customer’s point of view. If the customer insists on some reference to outcomes, the supplier should agree to no more than tying the acts to the specific provisions of the specifications, with some allowance for error. For example, a supplier would want to agree an acceptable error rate for the conversion of the customer’s data (as no conversion process can be guaranteed to be 100% accurate), perhaps combined with a provision for correcting mistakes that are found during a specified period.
 
While the ideal situation for the supplier would seem to be to have no obligations as to the standard of work carried out, in practice the courts are likely to view the absence of any such obligation as unreasonable. The standards set out in clause 8.1 do go somewhat further than the legally implied obligation of reasonable skill and expertise, but should be achievable by any competent supplier. Note that the outcome is expressed as meeting the requirements of the technical specification, rather than the business requirements specification (see  and  above).
 
It is rare for a brand new system to be installed. The customer will almost always have an existing system which the supplier is going to either upgrade or replace. In either event, the supplier will need to have both physical and remote access to the existing system (hardware and software) and to the customer’s data. This need for access () has to be balanced against the customer’s need to go on running its business while the new system is being developed. The customer must have an obligation to co-operate in carrying out the work, in particular to allow the supplier’s staff reasonable access to information and the site, and to provide necessary supplies for the supplier’s personnel working on the customer’s site. The customer may want more control over rights of access than this clause gives, but the supplier must be careful not to end up in a situation where the project cannot be completed on time because access is not provided, or where it ends up paying its personnel overtime from its own pocket because access is only given outside normal working hours (unless this expense has been factored into the agreed price at the beginning) (). The customer may also require that the supplier accept an obligation of responsible conduct to go with the right of access ().

   9.1  On the terms and conditions set out in this agreement, the Supplier agrees to:

   (a)  deliver and install the Supplier Hardware and Supplier Software at the Site(s);

   (b)  integrate the Supplier Hardware, Computer Hardware, Supplier Software and Customer Software to form the System;

   (c)  carry out, in conjunction with the Customer, the Acceptance Tests; and

   (d)  subject to , [use its reasonable endeavours to] provide the System Ready for Service by the Completion Date.

   9.2  [If requested to do so by the Customer, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  [promptly enter into a software maintenance and support agreement in a form to be agreed between the parties OR provide maintenance and support in accordance with [this agreement including  OR ]];

   (b)  [provide the training specified in the Implementation Plan at the rates provided for in that plan OR provide training in accordance with ,  and ];

   (c)  make available to the Customer suitably qualified personnel to carry out [such tasks on a consultancy basis concerning the Work as the Customer may specify OR tasks on a consultancy basis concerning the Work in accordance with this agreement including  and ];

   (d)  provide the Customer with disaster resources and business continuity services in accordance with this agreement including  and .]

   10.  PRE-INSTALLATION TESTING

   Pre-installation testing
 
There may be no need for pre-installation testing if the system is fairly simple and will only use standard software. In any other case, both parties have an interest in having pre-installation testing carried out. For the supplier, this allows for testing in a controlled environment and the opportunity to correct obvious errors and deal with problems before the customer sees the software. The customer also benefits, as its employees and business are not disrupted by problems with totally untested software. Clause 10.3 provides a mechanism for dealing with repeated material failure to pass the agreed pre-installation tests. The relevant periods (in square brackets in the standard document) will have to be agreed in the light of the implementation plan as a whole and the complexity of both the system and the software.

   10.1  Before delivering any item of Supplier Standard Software or Third-Party Software to the Site(s), the Supplier shall carry out reasonable tests to ensure that such item is in operable condition and is capable of meeting the requirements of the Technical Specification once properly installed.

   10.2  The Supplier shall carry out the Pre-Installation Tests on the Modified Software and Bespoke Software before delivery to the Site(s) in accordance with the following provisions:

   (a)  no later than [30] days from the date of signing this agreement, the Customer shall deliver to the Supplier proposed user acceptance criteria and test data for the Pre-Installation Tests for each module of Modified Software and Bespoke Software. These criteria and data shall be such as are reasonably required to show that each module complies with the relevant parts of the Technical Specification. The Supplier shall provide the Customer, at the Customer’s request, with assistance to prepare such user acceptance criteria and test data at the Customer’s request at the Supplier’s standard rates then in force. The parties shall use best endeavours to agree the Software Pre-Installation Test Plan containing the Pre-Installation Tests for each module within [ten] days from the date of delivery to the Supplier of the proposed criteria and data, and such Software Pre-Installation Test Plan shall be annexed to this agreement as ;

   (b)  Within a reasonable time before the Actual Software Delivery Date for each Software Module, the Supplier shall carry out the agreed Pre-Installation Tests for the appropriate Software Module. The Supplier shall give the Customer at least 24 hours’ notice of the start of the Pre-Installation Tests and permit the Customer to observe all or any parts of the testing; and

   (c)  if the Software Module fails to pass the Pre-Installation Tests, the Supplier shall remedy the defects and deficiencies, and the relevant test(s) shall be repeated within a reasonable time.

   10.3  If the Software Module fails, in some material respect, to pass the Pre-Installation Tests within [four weeks] from the date of its second submission to the Pre-Installation Tests, then the Customer may, by written notice to the Supplier, choose at its sole discretion to specify (without prejudice to the Customer’s other rights and remedies) a new date for carrying out further tests on the Software Module on the same terms and conditions as are set out in . If the Software Module fails such further tests, then the Customer may:

   (a)  request a repeat test under this ;

   (b)  permit installation of the Software Module subject to such change of acceptance criteria, amendment of the Business Requirements Specification and/or reduction in the Price as, after taking into account all the relevant circumstances, is reasonable; or

   (c)  if the Supplier is unable to correct material defects within a period of [six] months from the start of Pre-Installation Tests under , reject the Software Module as not being in conformity with this agreement, and terminate this agreement.

   11.  DELIVERY, INSTALLATION AND DELAYS

   Delivery, installation and delays
 
The supplier must ensure that the customer is obliged to carry out all activities related to the site where the system is to be installed in a timely manner. Where the supplier is not providing hardware, the references to supplier hardware in clause 11 should be deleted. Similarly, if the customer is not supplying any hardware or software, clause 11.5 is not required.
 
This clause is favourable to the supplier in that the customer’s only remedy for delay is the payment of demonstrable reasonable costs. However, the payment of liquidated damages for delay in successful completion of the acceptance testing procedure is common in systems integration agreements, and the customer may insist on it, see .
 
The difficulty for the customer is in determining the sum that represents a genuine pre-estimate of its loss if acceptance of the system is delayed in order to make this an enforceable liquidated damages provision rather than an unenforceable penalty. For more information on the law relating to penalty clauses, see .

   11.1  Subject to , the Supplier shall [use its reasonable endeavours to] deliver each item of Supplier Hardware and each Software Module to the Site(s) on or before the applicable Hardware Delivery Date or Software Delivery Date (as applicable) for that item.

   11.2  The Supplier shall supply to the Customer, within a reasonable time before any relevant Actual Hardware Deliver Date or Actual Software Delivery Date, such information and assistance as may be necessary to enable the Customer to prepare the Site(s) for the installation of the relevant item of Supplier Hardware or Supplier Software.

   11.3  The [Supplier OR Customer] shall, at its own expense, prepare the Site(s) in accordance with the information provided by the Supplier in advance of each Actual Hardware Delivery Date or Actual Software Delivery Date. The [Supplier OR Customer] may request reasonable assistance from the [Customer OR Supplier] to carry out such preparation.

   11.4  Subject to , the Supplier shall [use its reasonable endeavours to] complete installation of each item of Supplier Hardware and each Software Module at the Site(s) by the Installation Date for that item of Supplier Hardware or Software Module.

   11.5  The Customer shall be responsible for ensuring that each item of Customer Hardware and Customer Software is installed and is in working order and available to the Supplier no later than the relevant date specified in the Implementation Plan.

   11.6  If any delivery is delayed at the request of, or because of the acts or omissions of, the Customer, the Implementation Plan shall be amended to take account of such delay in accordance with . If the Supplier can demonstrate by documentary evidence that the delay has resulted in an increase in cost to the Supplier of carrying out its obligations under this agreement, the Supplier may, at its sole discretion, notify the Customer that it wishes to increase the Price by an amount not exceeding any such demonstrable cost. The Supplier may invoice the Customer for any additional monies that become payable in this way within [30] days of demonstrating the increase in costs.

   11.7  Subject to , the Supplier shall [use its reasonable endeavours to] provide the System Ready for Service on or before the Completion Date.

   11.8  If delivery of any item of Supplier Hardware or Software Module because of any act or omission of the Supplier or any third party manufacturer or the System is not Ready for Service by the Completion Date, the Supplier shall in all circumstances be liable for any reasonable costs that the Customer can demonstrate it incurred as a direct result of such delay.

   12.  SYSTEM ACCEPTANCE TESTS

   System acceptance tests
 
In any systems integration agreement that involves development of new software or the modification of existing software, the provisions for acceptance testing of the software are critical for both the supplier and the customer. This is because after acceptance the customer has no general legal right to reject the software and get its money back if it is defective, and can only sue for damages. The supplier will want to have a legally binding acceptance as early as possible, while the customer should try to delay the point in time at which it must accept the software until it has had time to fully test the software in normal use. Normally a compromise is reached through acceptance testing provisions (see ).
 
The acceptance tests are usually prepared and run by the supplier, but the customer may want to do this, or at least have an involvement that extends beyond the provision of the test data.
 
The acceptance tests in Annex 6 are important. This document will normally have two parts:
 
A testing procedure, including timetable and specification of tests to be performed.
A set of performance criteria for each test.
As it is almost unknown for this document to be agreed before the contract is signed,  provides a mechanism for preparing and agreeing this document.
 
The two parties need to reach a compromise between their competing interests in agreeing the tests and the required performance. The customer will prefer to go on testing for a long time to ensure that all problems are identified and remedied before the system is accepted (and acceptance payments are made), while the supplier will prefer short and simple tests leading to early acceptance, leaving any problems to be ironed out later under the maintenance agreement.
 
Where various software modules comprise part of the system, acceptance testing is likely to involve acceptance testing of the individual software modules and another set of tests on the whole set of modules as installed, to ensure that they work together properly and fulfil the business requirements specification. It is possible for the individual modules each to work correctly, but for the interfacing between them to be defective or for interference to occur between individual modules.
 
For more information, see  and .

   12.1  No later than [30] days from the date of signature of this agreement, the Customer shall deliver to the Supplier proposed user acceptance criteria and test data for the Acceptance Tests for the System. These criteria and data shall be such as are reasonably required to show that the System complies with the Technical Specification. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with reasonable assistance to prepare such user acceptance criteria and test data at the Customer’s request. The parties shall use best endeavours to agree the Acceptance Tests for the System within [ten] days from the date of delivery to the Supplier of the proposed criteria and data.

   Preparing the testing protocol
 
It is unusual for the acceptance testing documents to be agreed before the systems integration agreement is signed. Clause 12.1 provides a timetable (which will depend on the complexity of the software and the capabilities of the parties) and a procedure for agreeing the acceptance tests.

   12.2  Within [ten] days of the Actual Installation Date, the Acceptance Tests shall be carried out. The Acceptance Tests shall be started as soon as reasonably possible after installation and shall be run continuously during Normal Working Hours. The Supplier shall carry out the agreed Acceptance Tests for the System unless the Customer notifies the Supplier, not later than five days after the Actual Installation Date, that it will carry out the Acceptance Tests. The party carrying out the Acceptance Tests shall give the other party at least 24 hours’ notice of the start of the Acceptance Tests and permit the other party to observe all or any part of the testing.

   Carrying out the tests
 
Clause 12.2 provides that the supplier will normally carry out the tests, with the customer having the right to observe. Sophisticated customers with their own IT capabilities should insist on running the tests themselves, but should allow the supplier to be involved, as excluding the supplier from the testing process is likely to result in disputes if the customer alone decides the test criteria have not been met.

   12.3  If the System fails to pass the Acceptance Tests, the Customer shall, within [NUMBER] days from the completion of the Acceptance Tests, or any part of these tests, provide a written notice to this effect, giving details of such failure(s). The Supplier shall remedy the defects and deficiencies and the relevant test(s) shall be repeated within a reasonable time.

   12.4  If the System fails in some material respect to pass any repeated Acceptance Tests within [four weeks] from the date of its second submission to the Acceptance Tests, then the Customer may, by written notice to the Supplier, choose at its sole discretion:

   (a)  to fix (without prejudice to the Customer’s other rights and remedies) a new date for carrying out further tests on the System on the same terms and conditions. If the System fails such further tests then the Customer may request a repeat test under this ; or

   (b)  to accept the System subject to such change of acceptance criteria, amendment of the Technical Specification and/or reduction in the Price as, after taking into account all the relevant circumstances, is reasonable; or

   (c)  if the Supplier is unable to correct material defects within a period of [three] months from the commencement of Acceptance Tests under , to reject the System as not being in conformity with the agreement, in which event the Customer may terminate this agreement.

   Test failures (clauses 12.3 and 12.4)
 
Software rarely works correctly first time. A reasonable balance must be struck between the supplier’s interest in completing and being paid for the software and the customer’s need to have working software, which may at the worst involve scrapping seriously faulty software and starting again with a different supplier. Clauses 12.3 and 12.4 are fairly standard provisions dealing with failure to complete the agreed acceptance testing procedure successfully. The supplier should insist that the right to reject the software under clause 12.4(c) does not arise unless the defects are material (although the definition of that term itself is a possible ground for dispute) and until the supplier has been given a reasonable time to correct them.

   13.  SYSTEM ACCEPTANCE

   System Acceptance
 
Delay in acceptance caused by the customer is of great concern to the supplier in a fixed-price contract, or where a significant proportion of the price is payable on formal acceptance. The supplier will be less concerned if the contract is on a time-and-materials basis and has pre-agreed billing periods, although delay could still adversely affect its ability to do work for other clients. This clause is drafted to ensure that the customer does not drag its feet in carrying out any of its obligations relating to the acceptance testing process. See .
 
For more information, see .

   Acceptance of the System shall be deemed to have occurred on whichever is the earliest of:

   (a)  the signing by the Customer of an Acceptance Certificate for the last Software Module to pass the Acceptance Tests;

   (b)  the expiry of [five days] after the completion of all the Acceptance Tests, unless the Customer has given any written notice under ;

   (c)  the expiry of [ten days] after the Actual Installation Date of the final Software Module if the Acceptance Tests for that module have not started, or have not been pursued with due diligence, unless such failure results from the Supplier’s failure to co-operate in the performance of the Acceptance Tests; or

   (d)  the use of the System by the Customer in the normal course of the Business.

   14.  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND EXTENSION OF TIME

   Implementation Plan and extension of time
 
This important clause, which sets out the timetable for each stage of the project, will initially be prepared by the supplier as part of the tender documents. A version agreed by both parties should be in existence by the time the contract is signed and annexed to the agreement.
 
Delays are a major cause of disputes over software development projects, so it is important that each party carries out its obligations in a timely fashion. However, it is inevitable in all but the simplest projects that there will be unforeseen events that cause delay. The contract must contain a mechanism for controlling delay so that it does not get out of hand. This is provided by clauses 14.3 to 14.5. If the parties cannot agree on an extension of time (), it is essential to have a speedy way of resolving this (see ). For more information, see .

   14.1  Both parties shall [use their reasonable endeavours to] perform their obligations under this agreement in accordance with the Implementation Plan.

   14.2  The Supplier shall [use its reasonable endeavours to] complete the Work in each stage of the Implementation Plan by the date specified in the Implementation Plan, subject to .

   14.3  The Supplier shall be given an extension of time for completion of any one or more of the stages in the Implementation Plan, or any of its other performance obligations under this agreement, if one of more of the following events occurs:

   (a)  a variation to the System is made at the Customer’s request under the change control procedures set out in  or ;

   (b)  a force majeure event occurs as described in ; or

   (c)  delay is caused in whole or in part by an action or omission of the Customer or its employees, agents or third party contractors.

   14.4  If the Supplier is entitled to an extension of time under , it shall give written notice to the Customer not later than seven days after the beginning of the event. Such notice shall specify the event relied on and, in the case of a force majeure event under , shall estimate the probable extent of the delay.

   14.5  The Customer Representative and the Project Manager shall use best endeavours to agree in writing, signed by both parties, what extension of time is reasonable in the circumstances. The Implementation Plan, or performance obligation, shall be deemed amended accordingly.

   15.  PAYMENT

   Payment
 
The standard document does not specify how the price is calculated or paid, so it could cover either a fixed-price or a time-and-materials basis for charging, or some combination of the two.
 
The customer needs as much predictability in the cost of the system as possible. However, the supplier will only want to give a fixed-price quotation for a simple system or where little customisation of an established system is required to meet the customer’s requirements. The customer should not accept an open-ended time-and-materials charging basis unless there is little risk that the expected cost will be significantly increased by the end of the project. This means that a system of charging has to be negotiated that provides some sharing of the risk of cost increases between the parties. The degree of sharing will probably depend on the relative negotiating power of each party.
 
The customer should seek a provision that fee rates remain fixed for the duration of the contract, but the supplier may not be willing to agree to this if the project is expected to take more than a year to perform, particularly if inflation is significant. For longer periods, a method of increasing fee rates could be provided (similar to clause 15.5, which applies to the support charges).
 
Training costs can be included in the price or paid for separately. Support charges, consultancy charges and charges for business continuity and disaster recovery services are generally paid for separately. All these items should be included in Schedule 4 under the appropriate headings.

   15.1  The Supplier shall submit invoices in accordance with . The Customer shall make payment of each invoice by the due date stated in that invoice or within 30 days of receipt of the invoice, whichever is later.

   Clause 15.1
 
The details of how and when payments are to be made must be agreed and included in Schedule 4. The supplier will almost always want to have staged payments so as to maintain a cash flow to meet expenses. In return, the customer will probably seek to have payments tied to measurable progress in the project. This is often done by having a schedule setting out the milestones (specified events) and the amount payable on achievement of each milestone. The customer will probably seek to have these payments heavily weighted towards the final stages of the project, but the supplier should point out that it is not in the customer’s interest to cause the supplier severe cash-flow problems, which in the case of a small company could put its future at risk either during the project or during any subsequent maintenance period.
 
 
Clauses 15.1 and 15.4
 
Schedule 4 should state when payments on any invoice are due, and permit the supplier to charge interest on late payments. Suppliers should also reserve the right to suspend work or even terminate the agreement for a failure to pay after an extended period or repeated late payments. Failure to receive regular payments on time can cause severe cash-flow problems to a small supplier who must, in any event, continue to pay its employees or contractors regularly. The customer may seek to have a provision allowing it to withhold disputed amounts during dispute resolution. If the supplier agrees to this, there must be a provision for interest to be payable on any amount that the supplier is found to be entitled to at the end of the dispute resolution procedure.
 
For information on interest clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to  and .

   15.2  The Customer shall pay the Support Charges on the Support Commencement Date and on each anniversary of that date. The Supplier shall invoice the Customer for the Support Charges no later than 30 days before any anniversary of the Support Commencement Date at the invoicing address specified in .

   15.3  The Price, the Support Charges and all other payments stated in  are exclusive of VAT. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a valid VAT invoice. [The Customer shall pay any stamp duties or similar transfer taxes imposed on the supplies made under this agreement and shall reimburse the Supplier for any such stamp duties or similar transfer taxes paid by the Supplier.] If the Customer is required to make any deduction for or on account of tax from any payment due under this agreement (Tax Deduction):

   (a)  the Customer shall account to the relevant tax authority for such Tax Deduction and shall provide evidence to the Supplier that it has so accounted.

   (b)  the amount of the payment due under this Agreement shall be increased so that the Supplier receives an amount equal to the amount that would have been received by it, had the Customer not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   The Customer and the Supplier shall co-operate to minimise the amount of any Tax Deduction. If following the making of a Tax Deduction, the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion/ acting in good faith] that it (or any member of the Supplier’s group) has received and retained any credit, relief or other benefit as a result of the Tax Deduction, the Supplier shall pay such amount to the Customer as the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion/ acting in good faith] would leave the Supplier in the same position as if the Customer had not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   Tax
 
Unless each party wishes to bear the tax risks “as they fall”, there must be appropriate provisions relating to tax payments (such as value added taxes) and tax withholding requirements. It may be necessary to have wording to deal with tax withholding, particularly in respect of licence fees, where that is relevant. It is always advisable to obtain expert tax advice on the structuring of payments before any agreement is entered into.

   15.4  [If the Customer fails to make any payment due to the Supplier under this agreement by the due date for payment, the, without limiting the Supplier’s remedies under [TERMINATION CLAUSE],] the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [4]% per annum above [FULL NAME OF BANK]’s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.

   Interest on overdue payments
 
See  and .

   15.5  The Supplier may increase the annual charge at any [time OR anniversary of the Support Commencement Date after the [first OR second] such anniversary by giving the Customer at least [three months’] notice before such anniversary].

   Price increases
 
This clause provides that fee rates remain fixed for the duration of the contract (as is often requested by the customer). The supplier should only agree to a provision if the project is expected to take less than a year to perform. For longer periods, a method of increasing fee rates should be provided for. The customer may seek to limit its exposure with a condition that these increases should only happen on contract anniversaries and be limited to the average rate of inflation during the preceding 12 months, as measured by an official index.

   15.6  All invoices issued by the Supplier under or in connection with this agreement shall be accompanied by a sufficiently detailed breakdown of the matters being invoiced (including [details of time taken to perform services per individual and] any additional costs under ).

   15.7  Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses may be charged by the Supplier on production of reasonable evidence of expenditure to the Customer.

   Expenses
 
Expenses must also be dealt with. Where, in addition to the contract price or its normal fees, the supplier is entitled to charge expenses such as travel costs for its personnel visiting the customer’s premises, standards of travel and accommodation should be agreed in writing in advance.

   15.8  For the duration of this agreement, and for a period of [seven] years from termination or expiry of this agreement, the Supplier shall maintain full and accurate records, in a form to be approved in writing by the Customer, of all charges, prices, costs and expenses associated with and invoiced in respect of the System and the Services.

   Records
 
Record keeping by the supplier is important to help verify invoices and deal with disputes over amounts payable and is in the interests of both parties. The customer will typically have the right to inspect these records () and on reasonable notice (). The supplier should insist that exercise of this right be limited to reasonable intervals, for example, annually ().

   15.9  At the Customer’s request and its expense, the Supplier shall [grant access OR produce] to the Customer or its designated auditors [to the premises,] records and accounts of the Supplier [and its] [Affiliates] [and] [subcontractors] relevant to the System or the Support Services[, including its [and their] data processing facilities, and to such of its and their supporting documentation and explanations from Support Staff as is reasonable to ascertain compliance with this agreement].

   Audit access
 
Suppliers should ensure that the scope of its obligation under any audit clause is clearly defined. See () (reported in ), where the High Court has considered what type of information and documents must be disclosed under an audit clause in an agreement to supply services, and in what circumstances it is permissible to withhold such information.
 
The audit provisions under this agreement should be reviewed to ensure they reflect any audit obligations which are contained in any applicable data protection legislation, see  and .

   15.10  Such access shall be granted no more than once during any Contract Year during Normal Business Hours and will be subject to reasonable prior notice from the Supplier[, except to the extent that such access is required by the Customer’s regulators outside of these parameters].

   15.11  If, on such examination, the Customer determines that any charges, prices, costs or expenses exceed or fall short of the amounts properly chargeable to, or recoverable from, the Customer, an appropriate adjustment shall be effected between the parties promptly.

   15.12  If the Supplier visits the Site(s) at the Customer’s request to investigate a failure of the System, which proves in the Supplier’s reasonable opinion not to have been caused by a Defect, the Supplier may charge the Customer for the time spent on such visit on a time-and-materials basis at its standard rates then in force.

   16.  CHANGE CONTROL AND TECHNOLOGY SUBSTITUTION

   Change control and technology substitution
 
It is vital to the success of any systems integration project that changes are managed in a controlled manner. This is particularly true of changes to software, which can have knock-on effects such as delaying completion of the system and increasing costs.
 
The key elements for pricing are certainty and flexibility, both in terms of providing performance incentives, and also to provide some means of control over pricing. This is necessary in view of the potential dynamism of the services and potential changes to the service requirements.
 
However, changes made to the system during implementation can lead to delays and/or increases in cost. One of the difficulties of system integration projects is that the customer can rarely define exactly what it wants before any system integration work begins. During development it is common to find that an alternative would work better, or for the users in the customer’s organisation to discover that new software can add functionality, which they want but could not achieve with the old system. It follows that procedures to vary what is to be provided are essential in any system integration agreement.
 
Unless this change process is carefully controlled, the changes can cause serious delay and price escalation. Allowing uncontrolled variation is a proven recipe for disaster and dispute, particularly when the supplier’s personnel are working closely with the customer’s employees and therefore want to be helpful and provide whatever is asked for. Variations almost always add to the cost of the project and the time needed for completion. If it is a fixed-price contract, the supplier suffers, and if it is on a time-and-materials basis, the customer finds the system is more expensive than expected. In addition, both parties are affected by the extra time needed. Both parties, therefore, have an interest in controlling the variations that are made and the process by which they are agreed and incorporated in the main contract.
 
This clause provides a mechanism for controlling changes. However, in collaboration with the supplier, the customer must manage the contract carefully to ensure that this mechanism is always used. System engineers and programmers like solving problems and tend to ignore the official change control procedure unless they are properly managed.
 
In more complex systems where the supplier may not be able to accurately determine everything required for the system at the outset, the mutual form of clause 16.1 (using “either party” and “ the other party” in place of “ the customer” and “ the supplier”) allowing for change requests by the supplier should be used.

   16.1  The Customer may, by giving written notice to the Supplier at any time during the term of this agreement, request a change to the System.

   16.2  Within [seven] working days of receipt of such notice, the Supplier shall, at its standard rates then in force, prepare for the Customer a written [quote for] [If the changes are to be at a fixed price] OR estimate of] [If the changes are to be calculated on a time and materials basis] any increase or decrease in the Price, and of any effect that the requested change would have on the Implementation Plan.

   Estimates and quotes
 
Clause 16.2 provides the mechanism for determining the effects of any requested variation. As drafted it favours the supplier, in that the customer bears the cost of determining the effect of the requested variation. The time limit should be short but reasonable. What is reasonable may depend on the significance of the requested variation.

   16.3  Within [14] working days of receipt of the written [quote OR estimate] referred to in , the Customer shall inform the Supplier in writing of whether or not the Customer wishes the requested change to be made. If the change is required, the Supplier shall not make the requested change until the parties have agreed and signed a written agreement specifying, in particular, any changes to the Implementation Plan and Price.

   Change agreement
 
Agreed variations to the agreement must be recorded in a written document (defined as a Change Agreement in clause 1 by reference to clause 16.3). There is an inherent conflict between certainty and progress on the project. From the lawyer’s point of view, no work should proceed on a variation until a formal change agreement has been agreed and signed, therefore giving legal certainty as to the scope of the contract. Unfortunately this can take time, and meanwhile the parties will want to press on with work on the project. If work is to commence before the change agreement is agreed and signed, there has to be some mechanism for resolving disputes over the change agreement and dealing with a situation where the parties cannot reach an agreement, but work has been done on implementing the variation.

   16.4  The Supplier shall in its sole discretion offer to the Customer, and the Customer may at any time before the Actual Software Delivery Date choose to obtain from the Supplier, any item of software in substitution for any corresponding item of the System where the substitute item contains new technology or has better performance characteristics than such System. As part of the offer, the Supplier shall notify the Customer of any change in the Price which would result from such substitution. If the Customer chooses to obtain any such substitute item, the Supplier shall only be obliged to provide it once the parties agreed and executed a Change Agreement in accordance with .

   17.  OWNERSHIP

   Ownership
 
This clause is drafted in favour of the supplier, in that all rights in the software remain with the supplier. The customer is likely to object to this, at least with regard to software that has been written or modified specifically for it. The supplier should, if possible, resist agreeing to transfer ownership of these rights. There are a number of compromises that can be offered.
 
The supplier’s starting position should be that it retains ownership in all software originating from the supplier, including modified and customised software, which includes the right to license this software to other customers. The customer may object to this, especially with respect to the customised software for which it has paid the development costs. The supplier should strive to retain ownership although it may, as a compromise, agree not to license third parties to use the customised software or those particular modifications of the standard software that have been tailor-made for the customer. However, it would be prudent to limit this restriction to a specified period to minimise the risk of breaching UK or EU competition law, see .
 
For more information, see .

   17.1  The Intellectual Property Rights in the System are, and shall remain, the property of the Supplier or their appropriate third party rights owners(s).

   17.2  The Supplier reserves the right to grant a licence to use the System to any other party or parties and the Customer acquires no rights in or to the System other than those expressly granted by this agreement.

   17.3  The Customer shall do and execute, or arrange for the doing and executing of, each necessary act, document and thing that the Supplier may consider necessary or desirable to perfect the right, title and interest of the Supplier in and to the Intellectual Property Rights in the Bespoke Software, the Tools and the Modified Software (Supplier).

   17.4  The Customer shall use reasonable endeavours to prevent any infringement of the Supplier’s Intellectual Property Rights in the System and shall promptly report to the Supplier any such infringement that comes to its attention. In particular, the Customer shall:

   (a)  ensure that each Licensed User, before starting to use the System, is made aware that the System is proprietary to the Supplier (or appropriate third-party rights-owner) and that it may only be used and copied in accordance with this agreement;

   (b)  implement suitable disciplinary procedures for employees who make unauthorised use or copies of the System, except as provided for in ; and

   (c)  not permit third parties to have access to the System without the prior written consent of the Supplier, who may require that such third party executes a written confidentiality agreement before being given access to the System.

   18.  SOFTWARE LICENCE AND DOCUMENTATION

   18.1  The Supplier grants, subject to the terms of this agreement, the Customer [and its Affiliates] the non-exclusive, non-transferable right (subject to ) to use the Licensed Software [on the Computer Hardware] and the Documentation for any purpose related to the Business (Licensed Purposes).

   Clause 18.1
 
This is the most limited licence the supplier could give, as it is non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited to use of the software at the specified site, on the specified software, by a limited number of licensed users. It is likely that the customer will seek a broader licence, at least in relation to the software which it has paid to have written (Bespoke Software) or modified (Modified Software (Supplier).
 
For more information, see .
 
See also  in particular the commentary on licence term and contractual provisions against transfer contained in the resources referred to there.
 
 
No fees payable for grant of software licence
 
There are no separate provisions for charging for the software licence, apart from a fee if the number of licensed users increases above the specified limit. (This assumes that the licence fee is a lump sum included in the price specified in ) It is open to the parties to agree to reduce the initial price by providing for a royalty payable for use of the software. The pricing structure should be considered in line with each party’s right to terminate the licence and the agreement separately from one another, see .

   18.2  The Licensed Software may be used only by Licensed Users [at the Site(s)], except as follows:

   Site restrictions
 
 provides that the software must only be used by licensed users at the specified site, except in the circumstances set out in . These exceptions give the customer the necessary flexibility to run its business, including:
 
Moving.
Expanding the number of users.
Dealing with problems with the hardware or the site.
Replacing or upgrading the hardware.
This licence would not allow the customer to outsource operations using the system. Where the customer anticipates the possibility of such outsourcing, the supplier must negotiate suitable safeguards for its interests. For example, its confidential information will need protection if the company providing the outsourcing services is a competitor of the supplier. In addition, the supplier must be protected against (or recompensed for) wider use of the licensed software by the outsourcing company than is permitted by the licence. Where there is a maintenance contract, the supplier must be protected against increased demand for services.

   (a)  the Licensed Software may be used on any replacement for all or any part of the Computer Hardware that has been provided, or approved in writing in advance, by the Supplier;

   (b)  [the Licence may, with the prior written consent of the Supplier, be extended to additional Licensed Users, and  may be amended accordingly, provided that any appropriate additional fee is paid to the Supplier before such use;]

   (c)  [if the Customer transfers the whole of the Business permanently to another site, the Licensed Software may be used at the new site by the Licensed Users, provided that the Supplier is informed in writing of the change of site before use of the Licensed Software commences at the new site;]

   (d)  if the Computer Hardware becomes inoperable for any reason, the Licensed Software may be temporarily used on backup equipment until the Computer Hardware is repaired, and the Customer may use the Licensed Software for the purpose of testing whether any such backup equipment is suitable for use while the Computer Hardware is inoperable; and

   (e)  if any Site becomes temporarily unusable due to flood, fire or similar damage, or an emergency situation, the Licensed Software may be used at an alternative site until the Site is again useable, provided that the Customer gives the Supplier notice of such alternative site and permits the Supplier to inspect such site once the Licensed Software is again in use at the Site to ensure that no copy of all or any part of the Licensed Software remains at the temporary site. If the alternative site is managed by a third party, the third party must have signed a confidentiality undertaking addressed to the Supplier to protect the Supplier’s Confidential Information before the Licensed Software is transferred to the alternative site.

   18.3  The Customer shall comply with the Third-Party Licences and shall indemnify and hold the Supplier harmless against any loss or damage which it may suffer or incur as a result of the Customer’s breach of such terms howsoever arising.

   18.4  The Supplier may treat the Customer’s breach of any Third-Party Licence as a breach of this agreement.

   19.  TRANSFER OR REPRODUCTION OF LICENSED SOFTWARE

   Transfer or reproduction of Licensed Software
 
If the supplier retains proprietary rights, it is necessary to find a balance between protection of these rights and the customer’s need to make copies of the software for backup and security purposes.

   19.1  The Customer may make such copies of the Licensed Software as are reasonably necessary for use in accordance with this agreement and for the purposes of backup and security. The Customer has no right to make, or authorise the making of, any other copies of the Licensed Software.

   19.2  The Supplier shall at all times own all copies of all or any part of the Licensed Software. For copies recorded on a tangible medium, the Customer shall place on each copy of all or any part of the Licensed Software a clearly visible label indicating that the copy is the property of the Supplier and reproducing the Supplier’s proprietary rights notice. For electronic copies, the Customer shall ensure that all proprietary notices contained in the Licensed Software shall be maintained in such copies and shall display when the software is run, in the same way as in the case of the Licensed Software as supplied by the Supplier. The Customer shall keep all copies of the Licensed Software in a secure place when not in use and shall, at all times, keep all such copies in its possession or control.

   19.3  The Customer shall not:

   (a)  sub-license, rent, lend, assign or transfer in any other way this agreement or the Licensed Software to any person without the prior written consent of the Supplier; and

   Non-assignment of licence
 
See , in particular the commentary on contractual provisions against transfer contained in the resources referred to there.

   (b)  give access to the Licensed Software through any network of computers to users who are not employees or agents of the Customer.

   Network access
 
 deals with a situation where the software is used on a network, in particular where that network is accessible to people other than the customer’s employees, for example over the internet.

   20.  USE AND ADAPTATION OF LICENSED SOFTWARE

   Use and adaptation of Licensed Software
 
 and  mean that the customer is not able to perform maintenance or upgrading of the software itself without express consent from the supplier.

   20.1  The Customer may use the Licensed Software with other software.

   20.2  The Customer may not make adaptations or variations of the Licensed Software without the prior consent of the Supplier.

   20.3  The Customer may not disassemble, decompile, reverse translate or in any other manner decode the Licensed Software, except as permitted by law.

   Permitted acts
 
The law grants customers of software certain rights to copy, adapt and  software, some of which cannot be excluded by law (see  and ).

   21.  [SUPPORT SERVICES

   [

   21.1  The Supplier shall supply the Customer with New Releases in machine-readable form together with related amendments to the Documentation. The Supplier may make such New Releases available for downloading over the internet and will promptly notify the Customer when such downloads are available.

   21.2  The Supplier shall notify the Customer promptly in writing of the issue of any New Version, specifying the following:

   (a)  the charge for delivery and installation of the New Version;

   (b)  the licence fee payable for the New Version;

   (c)  in what way the New Version differs from the previous version in terms of functionality, performance and compatibility;

   (d)  the terms on which the Supplier will make the New Version available.

   21.3  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this agreement shall oblige the Supplier to provide, or the Customer to take, any New Version.

   Clauses 21.1, 21.2 and 21.3
 
The standard document distinguishes between new releases and new versions, a separate fee being paid for the latter but not the former. The supplier is not obliged to supply, and the customer is not obliged to take, any new version ().
 
Support services may include installation of new releases (), particularly where the system is complex or the customer does not have its own in-house IT support. Documentation for new functionality should be provided with each update. It is usually provided in electronic form. If there is a significant change in the system as a result of a new release, the customer may require extra training which is typically provided at an additional charge.

   21.4  [The Supplier shall ensure that support is available by telephone, email and fax during Normal Working Hours to provide assistance to the Customer in respect of the following:

   (a)  remedying Defects in the Supported Software; and

   (b)  providing advice on the use of the Supported Software.]

   21.5  [The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to correct Defects notified to it by the Customer in a timely manner appropriate to the seriousness of the circumstances in accordance with the following procedure:

   (a)  the Customer shall promptly notify the Supplier of all Defects. Where such notification is made orally, the Customer shall provide written confirmation (which may be sent by fax or by email) of the notification within [two] working days;

   (b)  within [two] hours of such notification, the Supplier shall acknowledge receipt of the notification and shall determine, in consultation with the Customer, how seriously the Defect affects the Customer’s operations;

   (c)  if a notified Defect halts or substantially impairs the Customer’s operations which use the Supported Software, the Supplier shall start work on correcting the Defect within [four] hours of receipt of such notification, shall use all reasonable efforts to correct the Defect as soon as possible and shall keep the Customer informed of progress towards the correction of the Defect;

   (d)  if a notified Defect, while not halting or substantially impairing the Customer’s operations, causes those operations to become significantly slowed or causes substantial inconvenience, the Supplier shall commence work on correcting the Defect within [48] hours of receipt of such notification and shall use all reasonable efforts to correct the Defect as soon as possible; and

   (e)  in the case of Defects other than those specified in  and , the Supplier shall start work on correcting the Defect as soon as the Supplier’s workload allows and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Defect.]

   Clauses 21.4 and 21.5
 
Very simple provisions for support services are contained in  and . Where the system is complex, especially where the customer’s business could be seriously affected by a failure of the system, it is advisable to have a separate maintenance contract with detailed performance provisions in which both service levels and service credits can be defined (see ). For more information on service credits, see .
 
 states generally what services the supplier will provide.  will be important to the customer as it provides the performance standards, such as time for response and an escalation of efforts to fix defects, depending on how seriously the defect affects the operation of the system. The specified timings are usually the subject of negotiation. Where the supplier and the customer are in different time zones, there will be negotiation about the hours during which the supplier will respond to requests for assistance and, if times are to run outside the supplier’s normal working hours, the supplier will no doubt cost this into the price for support services.
 
For more information, see .

   21.6  The Supplier shall use reasonable efforts to ensure the accurate migration of any data, but gives no warranties as to the completeness or accuracy of such migration. The Customer shall be responsible for checking the accuracy and completeness of the migrated data and shall promptly give sufficient details to the Supplier of any inaccuracies or omissions in order to permit the Supplier to correct them. If such data includes personal data, the Supplier shall return all copies of such personal data to the Customer on completion of the data migration process.]

   22.  [TRAINING

   Training
 
Delete this clause if no training is to be provided. The wording in square brackets in clause 22.1 should be deleted if there is no separate charge for training.
 
If the provisions for training are complex they should be included in Schedule 3. The supplier should agree a timetable with the customer and specify the location of the training and the maximum size of any training class. Where the training is included in the total price, the supplier should also specify the number of working hours of training provided for that price. If there are different elements of training, depending on the needs of particular classes of customer employees, Schedule 3 should contain a mechanism for the customer to request different types of training.

   22.1  The Supplier undertakes to provide the Training to the Customer [in consideration of the Training charges specified in ].

   22.2  Any additional training required by the Customer shall be provided by the Supplier at the Supplier’s standard rates then in force.

   22.3  Training shall be carried out at [the Site(s) OR the Supplier’s premises OR location(s) specified in ], or as may otherwise be agreed by the Customer. Any special equipment necessary for the Training shall be provided by the Supplier.]

   23.  SUPPLIER PERSONNEL: SYSTEM AND SUPPORT SERVICES

   23.1  The Supplier undertakes that its employees and contractors, while on the Site(s) or any other premises of the Customer, will comply with all relevant rules and regulations laid down by the Customer from time to time for the behaviour of its own employees [and contractors], as notified reasonably in advance to the Supplier in writing to the Supplier from to time. [Access to the same via the Customer’s intranet shall be deemed to satisfy such notification requirement.] The Supplier shall remove any employee or contractor whom the Customer can demonstrate has failed to comply with such rules, regulations and requirements.

   23.2  The Supplier alone shall be responsible for the supervision, direction, control, wages, taxes, national insurance and benefits of [the Support Manager and] the Support Staff. The Supplier assumes full responsibility for their acts and omissions and acknowledges that they are not employees or agents of the Customer.

   23.3  [During the term of this agreement and for a period of six months after its termination neither party shall, without the prior written consent of the other, solicit, or permit any Affiliate or Associate to solicit, the employment of any person who is employed by the other party in the course of developing, supplying, maintaining or supporting the Supplier Software or any part of it.]

   Clause 23.3
 
The optional non-solicitation provisions in clause 23.3 are primarily for the protection of the supplier. It is common for customers to want to hire the key supplier employee who has been responsible for the system integration once the system is up and running, as this enables them to bypass the supplier for much of the ongoing maintenance.
 
However, where the project introduces the supplier to a new market, the customer may find that the supplier wants to hire key customer personnel in order to develop other clients in that market and so will need this non-solicitation clause. The clause should always be mutual, and care should be taken to make the period reasonable. It should be proportionate to the importance of the system to the customer’s business and the length of time taken to complete the system integration project. If a court determines that either the period or scope of the restraint is not reasonable, it will be unenforceable.

   24.  SYSTEM: PROJECT MANAGEMENT

   System: project management
 
Good management of the project is vital to its success. This requires active involvement from both the supplier and the user, with backing from senior management in both cases. Many failed software development projects are the result of the customer thinking that it can leave everything to the supplier.

   24.1  No later than [five days] after the Commencement Date, the Customer shall notify the Supplier of the name and qualifications of the person appointed as the Customer Representative.

   24.2  The Supplier shall appoint the Project Manager, who shall have the responsibility and commensurate authority for the overall progress of the Work and to whom all questions regarding this agreement can be referred. The name and qualifications of the appointed individual shall be notified in writing to the Customer Representative.

   Clauses 24.1 and 24.2
 
Both parties have an interest in ensuring that the right people are appointed as customer representative and project manager (see  and ), because if these people communicate well with each other, have the right competencies and have sufficient authority within their respective organisations, there is a very good chance the project will be successful. As the success of the project depends to a large extent on the ability of these two individuals to work together, the parties should consider adding a mechanism for senior management to intervene and replace one or both of them if there is a serious personality clash.

   24.3  The Customer Representative shall co-operate with the Project Manager and shall attend meetings scheduled by the Project Manager at reasonable intervals not less than once a week to advise and assist the Supplier on all matters relating to the Work.

   24.4  The provision of employees, subcontractors and agents of the Supplier to carry out the Work shall be at the discretion of the Supplier.

   24.5  The Supplier agrees that the Project Manager [and [SPECIFY KEY STAFF]] shall not be replaced before the Acceptance Date without notice to the Customer, unless:

   (a)  the individual to be replaced is prevented by ill-health from carrying out their duties in connection with the agreement for a significant period;

   (b)  the individual resigns from employment with the Supplier;

   (c)  the contract of employment of the individual is terminated; or

   (d)  the Customer makes a reasonable, written request to the Supplier to replace the individual because they have performed unsatisfactorily or have caused a breach of any of the Supplier’s obligations under this agreement howsoever arising.

   Clause 24.5
 
In the interest of a successful outcome (which both parties share), it is reasonable to have a contractual agreement that the supplier will not remove the project manager (or any other key member of its team) from the project before final acceptance (see ). This is to ensure that highly skilled personnel, who are essential to the success of the project, are not reassigned by the supplier if a more lucrative project comes along. However, the supplier will usually resist agreeing to an absolute prohibition on moving personnel between projects (which could make its business impossible to manage efficiently). However, it should be prepared to agree that a few key individuals (and certainly the project manager) will not be removed without the customer’s consent. There should also be a mechanism for allowing the customer to request the removal of an individual and to be consulted about any proposed replacement before the change is made.

   24.6  If any such person is replaced, the Supplier shall consult with the Customer Representative about the identity of a suitable replacement.

   24.7  The Customer agrees that the Customer Representative [and [SPECIFY KEY STAFF]] shall not be replaced before the Acceptance Date without notice to the Supplier, unless:

   (a)  the individual to be replaced is prevented by ill-health from carrying out their duties in connection with the agreement for a significant period;

   (b)  the individual resigns from employment with the Customer;

   (c)  the contract of employment of the individual is terminated; or

   (d)  the Supplier makes a reasonable, written request to the Customer to replace the individual because they have performed unsatisfactorily or have caused a breach of any of the Customer’s obligations under this agreement howsoever arising.

   24.8  The Customer shall consult with the Project Manager about the identity of a suitable replacement.

   24.9  The Supplier shall:

   (a)  take all reasonable steps to maintain continuity in relation to the Support Staff team; and

   (b)  to the extent possible, give the Customer reasonable written notice of any proposed holiday or leave of absence to be taken by the Support Manager.

   25.  SUPPORT SERVICES: CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS

   25.1  During the term in which the Support Services are to be provided under , the Customer shall not, without the Supplier’s prior written approval, allow any person other than a representative of the Supplier to modify, repair or maintain any part of the Supported Software.

   Customer not to modify Supported Software
 
The supplier is likely to insist on including clause 25.1, otherwise it could incur considerable expense trying to find out what the unauthorised third party has done in order to put it right.

   25.2  The Customer shall co-operate with the Supplier in any manner reasonably required by the Supplier in order to carry out the Work, including provision of information and data, making available suitably qualified employees and contractors of the Customer and, subject to the Supplier’s compliance with the Customer’s normal security requirements [as specified in ]:

   (a)  provide access to the Customer’s systems for the purpose of carrying out diagnostics and correction of Defects, provided that such access shall be direct or remote, at the Customer’s option, and that, in the latter case, it will be subject to the Supplier’s compliance with any additional requirements for security and encryption techniques or software which may from time to time be specified by the Customer;

   (b)  provide such further access for the Support Staff to the Site(s) as is necessary to carry out the Supplier’s obligations under this agreement. The Customer shall obtain for the Supplier all permissions necessary to obtain such access;

   (c)  when the Support Staff are working on the Site(s), provide facilities and supplies reasonably required by the Supplier, such as power and computer consumables.

   25.3  The Customer shall, at its own expense, provide the equipment necessary at the Site(s) to enable the access referred to in  in accordance with the specifications set out in the Business Requirements Specification, but all other costs and expenses for such access shall be borne by the Supplier.

   Clauses 25.3 and 25.5
 
The supplier will need access to the system in order to correct defects. Where possible, remote access should be provided so that the supplier’s employees do not have to spend time travelling to the customer’s facility in order to work on the system. However, in these circumstances it is likely that the supplier will need to comply with additional security requirements. It is important to have one person at the customer (or a limited number of specified individuals) responsible for passing requests for assistance to the supplier and feeding back the responses, so that both the customer and the supplier can control and monitor the work that is being done on systems support.

   25.4  The Customer may, acting reasonably, restrict access to certain areas of its premises or systems on security grounds.

   25.5  The Customer shall, no later than the Support Commencement Date, appoint and maintain for the duration of the agreement an individual to serve as primary contact with the Supplier for the purpose of the provision of services under this agreement, and a deputy to that individual, and shall notify the Supplier of the names of those individuals promptly on their appointment.

   25.6  The Customer shall comply, as soon as reasonably practicable, with all the Supplier’s reasonable requests for information or assistance.

   26.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY

   Confidentiality and publicity
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes in .
.

   26.1  Confidential Information means all confidential information (however recorded or preserved) disclosed by a party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the other party and that party’s Representatives [whether before or] [after the date of this agreement] in connection with [DESCRIBE TRANSACTION OR CONTRACT], including but not limited to:

   (a)  the [existence and] terms of this agreement [or any agreement entered into in connection with this agreement];

   (b)  any information that would be regarded as confidential by a reasonable business person relating to:

   (i)  the business, assets, affairs, customers, clients, suppliers, [or] plans [, intentions, or market opportunities] of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)]; and

   (ii)  the operations, processes, product information, know-how, designs, trade secrets or software of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)];

   (c)  any information developed by the parties in the course of carrying out this agreement; and

   (d)  any information detailed in Schedule [NUMBER].

   Representatives means, in relation to a party, its employees, officers, contractors, subcontractors, representatives and advisers.

   26.2  The provisions of this clause shall not apply to any Confidential Information that:

   (a)  is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in breach of this clause);

   (b)  was available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before disclosure by the disclosing party;

   (c)  was, is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a person who, to the receiving party’s knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party or otherwise prohibited from disclosing the information to the receiving party; [or]

   (d)  the parties agree in writing is not confidential or may be disclosed[; or]

   (e)  [is developed by or for the receiving party independently of the information disclosed by the disclosing party.]

   26.3  Each party shall keep the other party’s Confidential Information secret and confidential and shall not:

   (a)  use such Confidential Information except for [the purpose of exercising or performing its rights and obligations under or in connection with this agreement OR [SPECIFY PURPOSE]] (Permitted Purpose); or

   (b)  disclose such Confidential Information in whole or in part to any third party, except as expressly permitted by this clause 26.

   26.4  A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to those of its Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, provided that:

   (a)  it informs such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information before disclosure; and

   (b)  at all times, it is responsible for such Representatives’ compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in this clause.

   26.5  A party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, by any governmental or other regulatory authority (including, without limitation, [ANY RELEVANT SECURITIES EXCHANGES]) or by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction provided that, to the extent it is legally permitted to do so, it gives the other party as much notice of the disclosure as possible [and, where notice of disclosure is not prohibited and is given in accordance with this clause 26.5, it takes into account the reasonable requests of the other party in relation to the content of the disclosure].

   26.6  [A party may, provided that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party is involved in activity that may constitute a criminal offence under the Bribery Act 2010, disclose Confidential Information to the Serious Fraud Office without first informing the other party of such disclosure.]

   26.7  Each party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights or obligations in respect of a party’s Confidential Information other than those expressly stated in this [clause OR agreement] are granted to the other party, or to be implied from this agreement.

   26.8  On termination [or expiry] of this agreement, each party shall:

   (a)  destroy or return to the other party all documents and materials (and any copies) containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the other party’s Confidential Information;

   (b)  erase all the other party’s Confidential Information from computer and communications systems and devices used by it, including such systems and data storage services provided by third parties (to the extent technically and legally practicable); and

   (c)  certify in writing to the other party that it has complied with the requirements of this clause, provided that a recipient party may retain documents and materials containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or any applicable governmental or regulatory authority. The provisions of this clause shall continue to apply to any such documents and materials retained by a recipient party, subject to clause 38 (Termination).

   26.9  [Nothing in this agreement shall prevent either party from using any Tools, knowledge of which is contained in the unaided memory of such party’s personnel [or those of its Affiliates] developed or disclosed under this agreement, provided that in doing so such party does not breach its obligations of confidentiality under this  or breach any Intellectual Property Rights of the other party [or any of its Affiliates]. An individual’s memory is only “unaided” with respect to any information if the individual has not retained a copy of the information and has not intentionally memorised that information other than is required to perform the Services.]

   Residual information
 
This optional clause allows each party to use the software tools to the extent that they reside in the unaided memory of the relevant person, that is, unprompted by, for example, a written record of the relevant information. Consider this text carefully before including it. If a party claims that particular information was not in the unaided memory of the relevant person, it is difficult to disprove this. Also ensure that any finally negotiated text here is consistent with clause 26.

   26.10  Except as expressly stated in this agreement, no party makes any express or implied warranty or representation concerning its Confidential Information.

   26.11  No party shall make, or permit any person to make, any public announcement concerning this agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as required by law, any governmental or regulatory authority (including, without limitation, any relevant securities exchange), any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction.

   26.12  [The provisions of this clause 26 shall [continue to apply after termination [or expiry] of this agreement OR survive for a period of [five] years from termination [or expiry] of this agreement].]

   No publicity
 
The supplier may not want to offer this clause in the initial draft, particularly where the customer is a well-known company, but it is reasonable for customers to want to vet what the supplier says to third parties about them and their system.
 
For information on announcements clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   26.13  The provisions of this clause 26 shall [continue to apply after termination [or expiry] of this agreement OR survive for a period of [five] years from termination [or expiry] of this agreement].

   27.  DATA PROTECTION

   Data protection
 
For more information on data protection, and the appropriate clauses to be inserted here, see .

   27.1  [INSERT APPROPRIATE DATA PROTECTION CLAUSES, SEE DRAFTING NOTE].

   28.  EXPORT [AND COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES]

   28.1  Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other party under this agreement (or any products, including software, incorporating any such data) in breach of any applicable laws or regulations (Export Control Laws), including United States export laws and regulations, to any country for which the United States or any other government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export licence or other governmental approval without first obtaining such licence or approval.

   Export control and sanctions
 
Technology export control laws are becoming increasingly pervasive and stringent around the world. In the UK, for example, there is the  (and various orders made under it) and similar laws in the US include the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Under US law a restricted asset may be deemed to be exported in a variety of circumstances, such as where services are performed by a non-US national outside of the US and this involves remote access to restricted assets in the US. For example, a software engineer in South East Asia might access a computer in the US for the purpose of performing maintenance on a restricted piece of software. Consider including a mutual indemnity, if there is a particular concern in this area.
 
For more information on export control, see .
 
The parties should also consider whether a proposed transaction is subject to any sanctions, noting that sanctions against Russia include a prohibition on the transfer of certain software and technology to a person connected with Russia or a place in Russia, see  and .

   28.2  Each party undertakes:

   (a)  contractually to oblige any third party to whom it discloses or transfers any such data or products to make an undertaking to it in similar terms to the one set out above; and

   (b)  if requested, to provide the other party with any reasonable assistance, at the reasonable cost of the other party, to enable it to perform any activity required by any competent government or agency in any relevant jurisdiction for the purpose of compliance with any Export Control Laws.

   28.3  [In performing its obligations under this agreement the [Supplier OR Customer] shall comply with the Mandatory Policies.]

   Compliance with policies (optional)
 
This clause can be used where the customer or supplier has specific business policies and wants to ensure that the other party complies with them. The policies might reflect a party’s legal obligations, for instance, its obligations under instruments such as the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Bribery Act 2010 or the data protection legislation. Alternatively, a party may have adopted business social responsibility policies voluntarily.
 
In most goods or services agreements, the obligation is usually on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. But this may not always be the case: depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, a supplier may well require the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies instead. As this is a pro-supplier agreement, the supplier may want to omit this clause altogether from the first draft provided to the customer.
 
If the supplier does choose to include this clause, there are two drafting options:
 
The first is a requirement on the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies. This is slightly unusual (the usual position is that a supplier agrees to comply with the customer’s policies), but a supplier who is concerned about its reputation may well want to ensure that it is only supplying goods or services to customers who are willing to comply with the supplier’s policies on issues such as anti-bribery, modern slavery and ethics.
The second option is a requirement on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. This is the more usual approach in a goods or services agreement. A supplier may include this option if, for instance, it has already agreed in principle that it is able to comply with the customer’s policies, or the parties already have an ongoing relationship where the supplier is comfortable with complying with the customer’s policies.
Whatever approach is taken, check that the definition of “Mandatory Policies” above is consistent with the approach in this clause.
 
Note also that if the customer agrees to comply with the supplier’s policies, the supplier may want a subsequent right to terminate the agreement if the customer breaches those policies. If this is desired, the supplier could include this additional right to terminate at . For an example of this, see .
 
For more information on general compliance clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   29.  WARRANTIES

   Warranties
 
These provisions must be read in conjunction with the general limitation of liability (see ).
 
The warranty under  is a form of warranty of title, which is normally implied by statute and is not usually possible to exclude. The advantage of giving an express warranty is that the remedy for breach can be limited in the way it is here. Also, the express exclusion of other warranties under  is more likely to be deemed reasonable (and therefore enforceable) if a reasonable warranty of performance has been given. Another advantage of giving an express warranty is that the remedy for breach can be limited, either by monetary amount or by the action to be taken by the supplier, as here.  is an important protection for the supplier, who should never promise to fix all defects, as this may be impossible. Similarly, the supplier should not agree to rush to fix defects which do not significantly affect the customer’s use of the system.
 
Suppliers may try to avoid giving any warranties as to performance, such as those in , but excluding all liability for performance by the supplier may be held by a court to be unreasonable and thus unenforceable. If satisfactory express warranties are given, it is reasonable for the customer to agree to the express exclusion of other warranties (). The supplier may try to exclude all liability if the customer makes unauthorised modifications of the system.
 
 and  provide the usual exemptions for the supplier regarding unauthorised use or modifications made by the customer.
 
The modified software (third party) and the third-party software are not covered by the warranties in . The customer should seek to rely on warranties given by the relevant third party in the licence agreement between the third party and the customer. If the customer agrees to do so, it might nevertheless ask the supplier to pass on to the customer any warranties given to the supplier by the third party. The supplier’s response to such a request may turn on the covenant strength of the third-party licensor.

   29.1  The Supplier warrants and represents that:

   (a)  the Licensed Software and Documentation are proprietary to the Supplier (except where otherwise stated in ) and that, as far as it is aware, it has the right to license all [UK] Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Licensed Software and Documentation to the Customer and to provide the Support Services to the Customer;

   (b)  [as far as it is aware, none of the Licensed Software or Documentation supplied by the Supplier under this agreement infringes the [UK] Intellectual Property Rights of any third party;]

   Non-infringement warranty (optional)
 
Rather than give the warranty in  the supplier may prefer, instead, to rely on the indemnity to be provided under . This will depend on the negotiating power of the parties.

   (c)  the System at the Acceptance Date, and for [six] months after that date, will perform in all material respects in accordance with the Technical Specification;

   (d)  it will perform the Support Services in a timely, reliable and professional manner, in conformity with Good Industry Practice by a sufficient number of competent Support Staff with appropriate skills, qualifications and experience, and has and will at all times have the ability and capacity to meet such requirements;

   (e)  it is in compliance with, and will perform the Support Services in compliance with, all applicable law and regulations (save for Cybersecurity Laws); and

   (f)  the Customer will receive good and valid title to all deliverables in connection with the Support Services, free and clear of all encumbrances and liens of any kind.

   29.2  The sole remedies for breach of the warranties in  [and ] are set out in .

   29.3  The sole remedy for breach of the warranty under  and this  shall be correction of Defects by the Supplier within a reasonable time from notification by the Customer of the Defect that constitutes such breach.

   29.4  The warranties set out in  are in lieu of all other express or implied warranties or conditions, including implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality and fitness for a particular purpose, in relation to this agreement. Without limitation, the Supplier specifically denies any implied or express representation that the System will be fit:

   (a)  to operate in conjunction with any hardware items or software products other than with those hardware items and software products that are identified in the Documentation as being compatible with the System; or

   (b)  to operate uninterrupted or error-free.

   29.5  The Supplier does not warrant or guarantee that it will be able to rectify all Defects, nor that any Defect which does not materially affect the Customer’s operations using the Supported Software will be corrected before the issue of the next New Release.

   29.6  Any unauthorised modifications, use or improper installation of the System by or on behalf of the Customer shall render all the Supplier’s warranties and obligations under this agreement null and void.

   29.7  The Supplier shall not be obliged to rectify any particular Defect if attempts to rectify such Defect other than normal recovery or diagnostic procedures have been made by the Customer’s personnel or third parties without the permission of the Supplier.

   29.8  [The Customer acknowledges that the only warranties in relation to the Third-Party Software and the Modified Software (Third Party) or the supply thereof are those contained in the licence from the third-party supplier(s) of the same, and that to the extent that any of such warranties are given to the Supplier, it will pass on the benefit of such warranties to the Customer [and its Affiliates].]

   29.9  [Any Open-Source Software provided by the Supplier shall be used according to the terms and conditions of the specific licence under which the relevant Open-Source Software is distributed, but is provided “as is” and expressly subject to the disclaimer in .]

   29.10  [Save in respect of any specific warranties given elsewhere in this agreement, the Supplier does not warrant or guarantee that the System, when taken in whole or in part, will:

   (a)  comply with Cybersecurity Laws, or

   (b)  contain no Vulnerabilities,

   and it shall be the Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure that the Business Requirements Specification and/or the Technical Specification detail all of the Customer’s cybersecurity requirements, including any requirements that might be imposed on the Customer’s business, operations or systems under Cybersecurity Laws, in sufficient detail so they can be implemented by the Supplier as part of the Work.]

   Compliance with cybersecurity laws (optional)
 
Various pieces of legislation effective in the UK (such as the  and the  (UK GDPR)) impose certain minimum security standards on networks and information systems (including those that process personal data). A breach of these provisions can attract substantial fines (up to £17.5 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, in the case of UK GDPR and up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations). For more information, see  and .
 
These security requirements are very rarely prescriptive, and (broadly speaking) require in-scope organisations to implement appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage risks posed to the security of the network and information systems on which their service relies (in the case of the NIS Regulations) and to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data (in the case of the UK GDPR).
 
Such measures must have regard to the state of the art, and (in the case of the UK GDPR) organisations are entitled to consider the costs of implementation in deciding what measures are appropriate in the circumstances. In the case of the NIS Regulations, OESs must have regard to any relevant guidance issued by their relevant competent authority and RDSPs must take into account compliance with international standards.
 
Accordingly, “appropriate and proportionate” measures are likely to change over time, based on new published guidance, developments in technology and the available state of the art (particularly for major projects, extended over a year or more).
 
For these reasons, suppliers are likely to want to resist any attempt by the customer to make them liable for any breach of these security standards, unless such requirements have been agreed in advance by the parties as part of the Business Requirements Specification or the Technical Specification, and particular limits of liability have been agreed in relation to the allocation of any regulatory fines, and other liabilities, that might result from any such security issues. The supplier will most likely want to argue that it is the customer who understands its own business operations (and its reliance on the System as part of those business operations) the best, in order to decide what security measures are appropriate in the circumstances. Alternatively, the supplier may wish to charge the customer an additional consulting fee for providing cybersecurity advice.
 
With this in mind, we have included an optional carve-out in  to make it clear that the supplier is not taking any responsibility for cyber-issues unless these requirements form part of the Business Requirements Specification or the Technical Specification, which the supplier has signed off on.
 
Where the supplier is providing maintenance, or hosting, services, and one of the objectives of that service is to safeguard the System against cyber-risks and attacks, the customer may try to impose certain cyber obligations on the supplier as part of the service warranties to be agreed. We recommend such obligations are restricted to the taking of such reasonable steps that a supplier should be expected to take to safeguard against cyber incidents in accordance with good industry practice, to be judged contemporaneously at the time the service is provided (as cyber standards are bound to change over time).

   29.11  The Customer:

   (a)  warrants to the Supplier that it will at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to its activities under this agreement and in connection with any part of the Supplier Software;

   (b)  shall take reasonable steps not to introduce any Virus or Vulnerability to the Supplier Software or the network and information systems of the Supplier;

   (c)  shall indemnify the Supplier against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal and other [reasonable] professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by the Supplier arising out of any non-compliance by the Customer with this .

   29.12  Each party warrants that it has full capacity and authority, and all necessary licences, permits and consents, to enter into and perform this agreement, and that those signing this agreement are duly authorised to bind the party for whom they sign.

   30.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY

   30.1  The Supplier shall indemnify the Customer for any amounts awarded against the Customer in judgment or settlement of any claim arising out of or in connection with any claim that the Customer’s use of the Licensed Software or Documentation, or the Customer’s receipt of the benefit of the Services, in each case in accordance with this agreement, infringed a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, provided that, if any third party makes a claim, or notifies an intention to make a claim, against the Customer which may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under this indemnity (Claim), the Customer:

   IP indemnity
 
This clause provides the customer with protection in the form of an indemnity against third-party claims that its use of the licensed software infringes the IPRs belonging to that third party (see ). The supplier will usually be prepared to meet the customer’s concerns in this respect, at least as far as any licensed software is concerned, although the exact scope of that protection will be the subject of negotiation and the supplier may seek various exclusions – see .
 
The customer may push for the indemnity to cover the entire system (not just the software which is licensed under ) but the supplier may require the customer to rely on any separate indemnity to be provided by the relevant third party software licensor under the customer’s direct licence with that third party.
 
From the supplier’s perspective, it is important to ensure that there is nothing in the agreement (in particular,  or ) that provides that the cap on liability in  does not apply to the supplier’s liability under . Conversely, the customer will want to ensure that there is such a provision.
 
The proviso to  outlines the procedure to be adopted when a third party notifies the customer of an alleged IPR infringement. It is drafted as a proviso to the indemnity obligation so that, if the customer does not meet any such condition, the supplier is no longer obliged to fulfil that obligation.

   (a)  as soon as reasonably practicable, gives written notice of the Claim to the Supplier, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;

   (b)  does not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Supplier (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed);

   (c)  gives the Supplier and its professional advisers access at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to its premises and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Customer, so as to enable the Supplier and its professional advisers to examine them and to take copies (at the Supplier’s expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim; and

   (d)  subject to the Supplier providing security to the Customer to the Customer’s reasonable satisfaction against any claim, liability, costs, expenses, damages or losses which may be incurred, takes such action as the Supplier may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, compromise or defend the Claim.

   Control of litigation
 
Under  the supplier will want to have control of any litigation, as the outcome will determine the extent of its liability under . However, the customer may wish to retain control to avoid protracted litigation and possible harm to its reputation.

   30.2  Without prejudice to , the Supplier shall not in any circumstances have any Claim:

   (a)  caused or contributed to by the Customer’s use of the Licensed Software, Documentation or Services in combination with software not supplied or approved in writing by the Supplier (other than the operating system of any Computer Hardware, provided that the Supplier was notified in writing of the identity of this operating system before this agreement was entered into);

   (b)  based on use of any version of the Licensed Software other than the latest version supplied by the Supplier, if such claim could have been avoided by the use of such supplied version; or

   (c)  where the claim for infringement arises in respect of a feature of the System which was specified by the Customer in the Business Requirements Specification.

   Exclusions from the intellectual property rights indemnity
 
 ensures that the supplier does not have liability if the third-party infringement claim arises from something the customer has done outside the authorised or expected use of the software, or from a feature insisted on by the customer.
 
It is reasonable for the supplier to take liability for any infringement which might arise from the combination of any software licensed and the operating software of the system hardware.
 
During the tendering process the customer should have notified the supplier of any existing software with which the new system is to work in conjunction, as this is relevant to operability issues. Once the system is accepted, it should have a way of notifying the supplier of any new software it is considering installing.

   30.3  If use of the Licensed Software, Documentation or receipt of the benefit of the Support Services becomes, or, in the opinion of qualified legal counsel, is likely to become, the subject of any such claim, the Supplier may:

   (a)  replace all or part of the System or Documentation or Services with functionally equivalent software, documentation or services without any charge to the Customer;

   (b)  modify the System or Documentation or Services as necessary to avoid such claim, provided that the System, documentation or services (as amended) functions in substantially the same way as they did before modification;

   (c)  procure for the Customer a licence from the relevant claimant to continue using the System, Documentation or Services (as the case may be).

   Remedies if the licensed software infringes
 
If the infringement action succeeds, the customer may face an injunction preventing it from using the infringing software. At worst, this could make the entire system unusable. The supplier will typically accept an obligation to take reasonable steps to keep the system usable, either by taking a licence from the third party or by replacing or modifying the system to avoid infringement. If none of these are reasonably achievable, the customer will seek to be in a position where it can obtain a non-infringing alternative as soon as possible.

   30.4  If:

   Termination if infringement cannot be remedied
 
The supplier should seek to protect itself under the provisions of  which allow it to terminate the licence where the infringement cannot be remedied after use of best efforts. In this event, the customer will probably ask that the supplier repay some or all of the money the customer paid for the software, so it might be tactically prudent for the supplier to insert in its original draft a limited repayment provision, perhaps specifying an amount which decreases the longer the software has been in use.

   (a)  use of the Licensed Software, Documentation or Services is determined in a court of law to be infringing;

   (b)  the Supplier is advised by a barrister of at least ten years’ call that use or possession by the Customer [or any of its Affiliates] of the Licensed Software or Documentation or Services in accordance with this agreement is likely to constitute infringement of a third party’s rights; or

   (c)  an injunction or similar order is granted in connection with any claim falling within the scope of  which prevents or restricts the use or possession by the Customer [or any of its Affiliates] of the Licensed Software or Documentation or Services in accordance with this Agreement,

   and the Supplier is unable, after best efforts, to procure for the Customer the right to continue using the System or the Documentation or the Services, or to provide the Customer with functionally equivalent non-infringing software, documentation or services this agreement and the Licence will be terminated.

   30.5  Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement,  shall not apply to the extent that any claim or action referred to in that clause arises directly or indirectly through the possession, use, development, modification or maintenance of any Third-Party Software or Modified Software (Third-Party) or through the breach of any Third Party Licence by the Customer [or any of its Affiliates] howsoever arising.

   Exclusion of third party software
 
 confirms that the indemnity obligation does not extend to third party software.
 
The supplier will likely want to exclude any third party software from the scope of the indemnity, as the nature of the code in question is beyond its control, and any claims could be brought by the customer directly against the third party licensor under the relevant third party licence (see ). However, this exclusion (or any other attempt to limit the scope of the indemnity in such a way) may be resisted by the customer, particularly where the supplier is selling itself as providing an “overall solution”.
 
For more information, see .

   30.6  If a payment due from the Supplier under this clause is subject to tax (whether by way of direct assessment or withholding at its source), the Customer shall be entitled to receive from the Supplier such amounts as shall ensure that the net receipt, after tax, to the Customer in respect of the payment is the same as it would have been were the payment not subject to tax.

   30.7  Nothing in this clause shall restrict or limit the Customer’s general obligation at law to mitigate a loss it may suffer or incur as a result of an event that may give rise to a claim under this indemnity.

   31.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   Limitation of liability
 
 
Overview
 
This clause is key to management of the Supplier’s risk.
 
Ideally, the Supplier would want to exclude all its liability to the Customer, but the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA) (where it applies) effectively prevents blanket exclusions and imposes a requirement of reasonableness as to the level of responsibility that the Supplier should bear.
 
For more information, see the following Practice notes relating to limiting liability in B2B contracts:
 
.
.
.
.
See also the parts of these Practice notes referred to in the drafting notes relating to the specific clauses.
 
Service level arrangements
 
If service level arrangements feature in the agreement that you draft, consider adding a clause similar to .

   31.1  Except as expressly provided in this agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

   (a)  the Customer shall be solely responsible, as against the Supplier, for any opinions, recommendations, forecasts or other conclusions made or actions taken by the Customer, any client of the Customer or any other third party based (wholly or in part) on the results obtained from the use of the System or the Services by the Customer;

   (b)  the Supplier shall have no liability for any damage caused by errors or omissions in any information or instructions provided to the Supplier by the Customer in connection with the Services; and

   (c)  all warranties, representations, conditions and all other terms of any kind whatsoever implied by statute or common law are excluded from this agreement.

   Acknowledgements and exclusion of warranties
 
 seeks to exclude statutory implied terms, to the extent that this is legally possible. See  and  and .

   31.2  Neither party excludes or limits liability to the other party for:

   (a)  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;

   (b)  death or personal injury caused by negligence;

   (c)  a breach of any obligations implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982; or

   (d)  any matter for which it would be unlawful for the parties to exclude liability.

   No exclusion or limitation
 
There are various types of loss for which liability must remain unlimited, because the law prevents them being excluded. See  and .

   31.3  Subject to , the Supplier shall not in any circumstances be liable whether in contract, tort (including for negligence and breach of statutory duty howsoever arising), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, for:

   (a)  any loss (whether direct or indirect) of profits, business, business opportunities, revenue, turnover, reputation or goodwill;

   (b)  any loss or corruption (whether direct or indirect) of data or information;

   (c)  loss (whether direct or indirect) of anticipated savings or wasted expenditure (including management time); or

   (d)  any loss or liability (whether direct or indirect) under or in relation to any other contract.

   Exclusions
 
This clause seeks to exclude various categories of loss.
 
The distinction between direct and indirect loss is not clear cut and there is no easy formulation to determine on which side of the line a category or type of loss falls in any specific case. A particular difficulty arises when deciding whether loss of profits is direct or indirect. Accordingly, this clause seeks to exclude certain types of loss, whether direct or indirect. See  and  and .
 
This clause is drafted in the form of a series of sub-clauses with the aim that if one sub- clause is held unreasonable, it can be severed from the other provisions, which will remain enforceable. See .
 
Clear words must be used if an exclusion or restriction of liability for negligence is to be effective. See .
 
The exclusion of liability for negligence is subject to the UCTA reasonableness test. See  and .
 
Whether an exclusion or restriction of liability for deliberate breaches is effective is a matter of construction. However, clear words must be used. See .

   31.4   shall not prevent claims, which fall within the scope of , for:

   (a)  direct financial loss that are not excluded under any of the categories set out in  to ; or

   (b)  tangible property or physical damage.

   Claims not prevented
 
This clause expressly states that there are other types of loss for which liability has not been excluded-under , including loss of property. Case law indicates that making the distinction between non-recoverable types of loss and potentially recoverable types of loss should help support a supplier’s argument that the clause is valid. See  and .

   31.5  Subject to , the Supplier’s total aggregate liability in contract [(including in respect of the indemnity at )], tort (including negligence and breach of statutory duty howsoever arising), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of this agreement or any collateral contract shall be limited to £[AMOUNT].

   Liability cap
 
This clause seeks to limit the Supplier’s aggregate liability under the contract to a fixed amount. Suppliers typically set the liability cap at an amount equal to 100% of the total fees. For longer agreements (for example, two years or more) suppliers will generally prefer to have an annual liability cap linked to a variable amount. For an example of this drafting, see clauses 13.3(b), 13.3(c) and 13.4 in .
 
Whichever approach is taken, you will need to assess whether the limitation is likely to be enforceable, bearing in mind the reasonableness test under UCTA and the matters that were considered in .
 
See ,  and  and  and the comments underlying the suggested liability cap in .
 
If this provision is held to be unreasonable under UCTA, damages would be recoverable without limitation, based on the ordinary contract law rules of remoteness. See .
 
Where this standard document is being used to create a framework agreement, the Customer may seek to ensure that the individual liability caps that apply to each of the relevant countries in respect of provision of goods or services are cumulative. Alternatively, the Customer may seek provision for two types of liability cap: the individual caps referred to above, and an overall cap regarding all claims arising out of the provision of goods or services to all the relevant countries. Clarity on these issues should be mutually advantageous.
 
The customer may also seek to cap its liability to the supplier, for example, if it is concerned about its liability under its obligations to the supplier.
 
Regarding the first set of optional text concerning the indemnity at , see .

   31.6  The parties acknowledge and agree that any dates quoted for delivery of the Work or the Support Services are approximate only, and that the time of delivery is not of the essence. The Supplier shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of the Work or the Support Services that is caused by an event, circumstance or cause within the scope of  or the Customer’s failure to provide the Supplier with adequate delivery instructions.

   Delay in delivery
 
The aim of this clause is to limit the Supplier’s liability for any delay in delivery. This limitation will be subject to the reasonableness requirement under UCTA (if applicable).

   32.  ASSIGNMENT AND SUBCONTRACTING

   Assignment and subcontracting
 
See .
 
See , in particular the commentary on contractual provisions against transfer contained in the resources referred to there.

   32.1  Subject to , this agreement is personal to the parties and neither party shall assign, transfer, mortgage, charge, subcontract, delegate, declare a trust of or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

   32.2  Either party may assign or subcontract any or all of its rights and obligations under this agreement to a member of its Group for so long as that company remains a member of the assignor’s group. The assignor shall procure that such company assigns any rights assigned to it in accordance with this  back to the assignor or another member of the assignor’s Group immediately before it ceases to be a member of the assignor’s Group. A party who subcontracts the performance of any or all of its obligations under this agreement to a member of its Group shall immediately resume the performance of such obligations on such company ceasing to be a member of its Group[, or delegate the performance of such obligations to such other member of its Group as it may nominate].]]

   32.3  [Where a party requests consent to an assignment or subcontract pursuant to , then, to help the other party reach a decision on the proposed assignment or subcontract, the first party shall provide the other party [with a copy of any proposed assignment agreement or subcontract, together] with any information that the other party may reasonably require about the proposed assignee or subcontractor. [If the other party gives its consent to the assignment or subcontract, the first party shall implement an appropriate system of [due diligence,] [audit,] [and] [training] for its assignee or subcontractor designed to ensure its compliance with the other party’s [SPECIFY RELEVANT BUSINESS POLICIES, E.G., ANTI-SLAVERY POLICY].]

   33.  DURATION

   Duration
 
Suppliers often rely on maintenance fees for a regular cash flow, so require at least a minimum period of maintenance and a fairly long period of notice if the customer decides to terminate the maintenance agreement. However, customers should avoid being tied to the supplier for maintenance indefinitely and need the right to terminate very quickly if the supplier fails to provide maintenance at all, or to provide it to an adequate standard or in a timely fashion.
 
Consider whether you need to make the operation of the agreement retrospective, for example, in relation to the confidentiality obligations.

   34.  TERMINATION

   Termination
 
This agreement covers three main supply obligations which are treated separately but are likely to be interlinked:
 
The provision of software development and system integration services.
The licensing of software (which may be pre-existing or still to be developed).
The provision of basic support services.
As such, the parties will need to consider how termination of one supply obligation will impact the others.
 
 has been drafted on the basis that:
 
Any termination of the main agreement (which is primary concerned with software development and systems integration) should not necessarily terminate the customer’s right to use any software already developed and provided to it (under the licence granted under ) or any support services being paid for, separately, in relation to that software.
Any termination of the customer’s licence to use the software should necessarily terminate the agreement and the support services, because they would be redundant without the customer first having the right to use the software.
However, the parties will need to consider whether the assumptions above are correct, bearing in mind the project being contemplated. Where the customer is expected to pay an additional value for the software licence (over and above the price of the development works) it may be easier for the customer to argue that the position above is fair. Otherwise, the supplier may argue that a breach of the customer’s obligation to pay for certain development works should entitle the supplier to terminate the underlying licence as well as the development services.
 
The position of each party will likely depend on:
 
How each of the work streams has being valued, and how they are being paid for.
How interconnected each work stream is (for example, is the overall solution dependant on the successful completion of the development work, or would the solution still work even if the contemplated development work is unsuccessful?).
Whether the customer would be permitted to take any partially completed development work and appoint a replacement supplier to complete the project.
When drafting termination provisions the customer should also consider whether it requires materials to be held in escrow, and released upon termination, to enable (for example) another supplier to take over the project in future (see ).
 
TUPE
 
The parties should consider the possible impact of the  (TUPE) on exit in the (unlikely but conceivable) event that one (or more) of the supplier’s employees is sufficiently dedicated to supporting the customer to transfer to the customer or a new supplier when the contract comes to an end. The customer may seek an indemnity from the supplier to cover this position. For further information, see  and .
 
Other matters
 
There are various matters of general administration, including the return of software and confidential information (see  and ).
 
Grounds for termination include:
 
Without cause, that is, for convenience (not usual in development projects, but relevant regarding maintenance and support arrangements).
For cause (for example, default).
Neutral, that is, force majeure.
(See .)
 
The grounds for termination include material or persistent breach. Overriding the contractual terms is the doctrine of fundamental breach, which in appropriate circumstances the customer might wish to invoke, bearing in mind that purporting to terminate on this ground when not justified in the circumstances may lead to the customer being in breach.
 
The terms “material breach” or a breach that is or is not “remediable” (both of which are used in ) or “repeatedly breaches” are not terms with precise legal definitions. It is not certain, for example, that a material breach equates to a repudiatory breach entitling the innocent party to terminate at common law. Consequently, there will always be some uncertainty as to the sorts of breaches that will give rise to the Supplier’s right to terminate (see  (see also ).
 
For further guidance on termination, see  and associated drafting notes, including information on the , which came into force on 26 June 2020. See also  and, in particular,  and the commentary around  and .
 
Clauses dealing with change of control (see ) require care. Refer to the definition of Control and ensure that it is appropriate in this context as well as its use in relation to the definition of Affiliate.

Any digital copies shall be considered permanently deleted, for the purposes of this  where they have been put beyond use by the Customer.

   34.8  This agreement shall automatically terminate on termination or expiry of the Licence, but the expiry or termination of this agreement (however caused) shall not automatically terminate the Licence or the Support Services.

   34.13  On termination of this agreement for any reason, each party shall as soon as reasonably practicable:

   (a)  return, destroy or permanently delete (as directed in writing by the other party) any documents, handbooks, CD-ROMs or DVDs or other information or data provided to it by the other party containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on Confidential Information belonging to the other party. If required by the other party, it shall provide written evidence (in the form of a letter signed by its [TITLE OF RELEVANT OFFICER]) no later than [NUMBER] days after termination of this agreement that these have been destroyed and that it has not retained any copies of them (except for one copy that it may use for audit purposes only and subject to the confidentiality obligations in ), provided that the Customer may retain copies of any Supplier Confidential Information incorporated into the Supplier Software or to the extent necessary to allow it to make full use of the Services and rights granted under any Licence or Third-Party Licence which is still in force;

   (b)  permanently delete any proprietary software belonging to the other party and not the subject of a current licence granted by the other party from its IT network and hard disks or other storage means associated with any computer equipment owned or controlled by the other party. Each party shall provide written confirmation (in the form of a letter signed by its [TITLE OF RELEVANT OFFICER]) no later than [NUMBER] days after termination of this agreement that this software has been deleted;

Until these are returned or repossessed, [the party in possession] shall be solely responsible for their safe-keeping,

   and any electronic data shall be considered deleted, for the purposes of this , where it has been put beyond use by the deleting party.

   Deletion of electronic data
 
It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to “delete” electronic data. The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK’s data protection authority) has opined that the term “deletion”, in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.

   34.14  On termination of this agreement for any reason, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  [promptly refund such portion of the Price or Support Charges (as the case may be) as relates to the period after expiry or termination on a pro rata basis];

   (b)  as soon as reasonably practicable, vacate the Customer’s premises leaving them clean and tidy and removing any goods, materials or equipment belonging to it. Any goods, materials or equipment that have not been removed after [NUMBER] days after termination of this agreement may be disposed of by the Customer as it thinks fit.

   Payments on termination
 
 has been made optional, on the grounds that suppliers may have priced the Work, or any associated software licence or support fees, on the basis that a minimum term be satisfied. In such circumstances, the supplier may be justified in arguing that where the termination is due to any reason other than a breach of the supplier’s obligations under the agreement, the customer should not be entitled to a refund of any upfront fees paid in respect of such minimum term.

   34.15  On termination of this agreement for any reason, the Customer shall immediately pay any outstanding unpaid invoices and interest due to the Supplier. The Supplier shall submit invoices for any Services that it has supplied, but for which no invoice has been submitted, and the Customer shall pay these invoices immediately on receipt.

   45.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION

   Dispute resolution
 
Disputes between supplier and customer almost inevitably arise during systems integration projects, most commonly from failures to communicate. On the supplier’s side, there is a natural reluctance to admit that things are not going to plan, so the customer may only become aware that there is a problem when it has become so great as to threaten the whole project. On the customer’s side, there is often a failure to communicate its requirements properly at an early stage, and a sense of failed expectations when the system does not meet these uncommunicated requirements.
 
See .
 
Standard boilerplate clauses often simply give exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of the country in which the party drafting the contract resides. Litigation should be the last resort for disputes arising during the implementation of a systems integration project as it is expensive, slow and adversarial. However, to leave the decision about the alternative method of resolving a dispute until the dispute has actually arisen is also a recipe for disaster as there may already be hurt feelings and a lack of trust at that point. It is, therefore, important that a carefully considered method of dealing with disputes is agreed and written into the contract before the project begins.
 
The usual method of approaching this is to provide for an escalation of methods, at first internal and then involving an outside party. The standard document provides for such an escalation, with the outside party acting as a mediator. There are a number of types of dispute resolution involving third parties.

   45.1  Any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning this agreement shall be determined as provided in this .

   45.2  For the purpose of this , a dispute shall be deemed to have arisen when one party serves on the other a notice in writing stating the nature of the dispute.

   Escalation (clauses 45.2, 45.4 and 45.5)
 
These clauses set out the escalation procedure for dealing with disputes. First, there must be a formal step for starting the procedure (). Initially, the supplier’s project manager and the customer’s project director should try to resolve the dispute if possible (). Many disputes can be nipped in the bud by good collaboration between these individuals so it is important that they have a good working relationship.
 
If these two individuals cannot resolve the dispute, it should then go to senior management (). However, this will only be successful if the senior managers have responsibility for, and ownership of, the project in their respective organisations and sufficient authority to take potentially risky decisions that are binding on their company. It is a good idea to provide for maximum time periods for both levels of discussion, as delay in resolving the dispute could itself endanger the project. On the other hand, the best settlement is always one reached by the parties themselves, so sufficient time should be allowed for this to happen.
 
In the standard document, failure by the parties to resolve the dispute themselves then leads to mediation (). There are also other methods of alternative dispute resolution that could be used (see ).
 
As a final resort, there needs to be a binding third-party adjudication, either by way of arbitration or court proceedings (). Arbitration and litigation both have their advantages and disadvantages, but neither is quick or cheap. You may wish to consider the arbitration services offered by the London Court of International Arbitration and the International Chamber of Commerce. The standard document attempts to assign the more suitable form to each of the potential kinds of technical and legal disputes, but there can even be disputes over the nature of the dispute. If arbitration is to be used, there should be provision in the agreement (Annex 9) for at least the basic rules and procedure to be followed as, unlike in litigation, there is no single, legally binding standard set of rules. Again, leaving these to be decided only after a dispute has arisen could lead to stalemate and the collapse of the project.
 
Arbitration is an option particularly where one or more of the parties are established outside the UK. Briefly, the advantages of arbitration are that the parties can set their own procedure (including joinder of parties such as subcontractors), arbitration may be better suited to an international dispute and the proceedings can remain confidential. For more information on the advantages of arbitration and on choosing appropriate arbitration rules, see  and .

   45.3  Unless this agreement has already been terminated by the date of the notice of dispute, the Supplier shall, in every case, continue with the Work with all due diligence regardless of the nature of the dispute and the Customer shall continue to make payments in accordance with .

   Continuing performance during disputes
 
Unless the situation is so serious that the agreement is terminated, both parties have an interest in continuing performance during the period the dispute is being dealt with. The customer should be required to make payments to the supplier pending resolution of the dispute. As a fall-back position, the customer should only have the right to withhold payments relating to matters in dispute, and the supplier needs to be certain that, once the dispute is resolved, it promptly receives any money that is found to be due. One solution is for the customer to pay the disputed sums into an escrow account. This is particularly important where the supplier has doubts about the ability or willingness of the customer to make the payments, and it prevents such a customer from raising artificial disputes in order to delay making payments.
 
For information on multi-tiered dispute resolution procedure clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   45.4  After service of the notice of dispute, the following procedure shall be followed by the parties (all periods specified in this  shall be extendable by mutual agreement):

   (a)  within [two] days, the Project Manager and the Customer Representative shall meet to attempt to settle the dispute;

   (b)  if the Project Manager and the Customer Representative are unable to reach a settlement within [seven] days from the date of service of the notice, the [managing directors] of each of the parties shall meet within the following [seven] days to attempt to settle the dispute; and

   (c)  if no settlement results from the meeting specified in  for the following [28] days the parties shall attempt to settle the dispute by mediation by an independent mediator, with costs to be shared equally between the parties.

   45.5  If no settlement is reached under :

   (a)  if the dispute is of a technical nature concerning the interpretation of the Business Requirements Specification or Technical Specification or any similar or related matter, then such dispute shall be referred for arbitration, to be carried out in accordance with the arbitration procedure set out in . The arbitrator’s decision shall (in the absence of clerical or manifest error) be final and binding on the parties and their fees for so acting shall be borne by the parties in equal shares unless they determine that the conduct of either party is such that such party should bear all of such fees;

   (b)  in the case of a dispute over purely legal issues, or where disposition of the legal issues would dispose of all other issues in dispute, the matter shall be brought before the English High Court in the most expeditious manner possible, and the parties agree to co-operate in the speedy conduct of such legal proceedings; and

   (c)  in any other case, the dispute shall be determined by the English High Court and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court for such purposes.

   46.  GOVERNING LAW

   Governing law
 
For information on governing law clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to  and .

   This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the law of England and Wales.

   47.  JURISDICTION

   Jurisdiction
 
The supplier should normally want to have the law of the jurisdiction where it is based as the governing law of the contract. However, customers who are government bodies or publicly owned are often required by law to contract under the law of their own jurisdictions, and very large customers usually want to specify the law of the jurisdiction where they are based. Negotiations on this issue may require the assistance of suitably qualified lawyers from the jurisdiction in question.
 
Any exclusive jurisdiction chosen in this clause could be different from the jurisdiction of the governing law, but this would increase the cost of litigation as the trial court would have to hear evidence on the relevant provisions of the chosen governing law. If provisions for alternative dispute resolution procedures are to be included in any of the sections, this should be referred to here.
 
See  for a consideration of choice of law and jurisdiction provisions.
 
For information on jurisdiction clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to  and .

   The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have [exclusive OR non-exclusive] jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).

   This agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of it.

   SERVICES, SITE AND COMMENCEMENT

   Services, site and commencement
 
The maintenance and support agreement may well contain service levels and service credits.
 
Typically, descriptions of service levels will specify content, volume of services and performance levels such as availability, response times and details about help desks. Service levels should be described in as much detail as possible. These details will depend upon the nature of the services being provided. In any event, the service levels should make clear the period over which they are to be measured, for example, weekly, monthly or annually. The customer will generally produce the first draft, but legal review and drafting is essential.
 
Performance will need to be monitored and reports prepared. Issues include who will measure the performance, what exactly will be measured, how often the measurement will take place and the reporting arrangements. These details will need to be consistent with the record-keeping obligations and access and inspection arrangements set out in clause 15.8 of the main agreement.
 
The consequences of service level failures will also need to be specified. Apart from the service credit regime, these may include damages and termination rights and practical remedies.
 
Service credits are a pre-determined payment and, accordingly, it is important to fix the amounts of the credits at an appropriate level to help ensure their enforceability, and to have a liquidated damages clause. In some cases, the supplier should request the inclusion of service debits as well as credits, to reflect performance which is greater than the relevant service levels.
 
Service credits need not be attached to all service levels. They might only apply to those which would have a business impact, if not met.

   Schedules and Execution
  
Schedules
 
Systems integration agreements typically have several schedules, which will contain details of matters and items to be provided under the agreement. The contract is more manageable if these details are in separate schedules at the end of the agreement rather than being set out in the body of the agreement, but the agreement must make it clear that these are contractual terms and conditions. It should also provide for possible conflicts between these documents (see ).
 
Where there are related agreements, for example, the software licence and maintenance agreement, they should be annexed to the main agreement. Annexation means that the agreements will be interpreted as related agreements. It also has the practical benefit of keeping all the agreements readily to hand in one place. The customer may assert that it is relying on representations made by the supplier in the response to the invitation to tender, in which case it will want to have these documents annexed to the main agreement. The supplier should strongly resist this, and may offer instead to incorporate in the agreement those specific representations the customer wants to rely on (see  and ).
  
Execution
 
Although witnessing is not essential for the proper execution of agreements, it is good practice, particularly in the case of material transactions. Different rules apply to deeds.
 
The authority may be given by, for example, board resolution or power of attorney, however it will be necessary to check that the company may validly delegate its powers in this way and that the authority was duly given. In the case of foreign companies, this will require an opinion to be obtained from lawyers in the relevant jurisdiction.

            Implementation Plan
 
The implementation plan is almost certain to be amended during the project (see ). Both parties should set up a procedure to ensure that any agreed variation to the plan is recorded by attaching an amended project plan schedule, so that the agreement is kept up to date (see ).

                     Acceptance Tests
 [
This annex must contain details of the tests to be carried out and the criteria that must be met in order for the tests to be successful. Ideally, the annex will be finalised before the systems integration project begins. However, in reality it is very rare for it to be completed before work begins for any but the simplest systems. This is because with most systems there has to be a preliminary period while the design is refined in the light of detailed discussions between the customer and supplier. Both tests and performance criteria will need to be amended to match the final design. If an acceptance testing procedure is not agreed by the time the systems integration agreement is signed, the agreement will need to have provisions dealing with how a procedure is to be agreed.
