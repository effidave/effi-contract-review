The agreement is drafted to be broadly neutral between the parties.\n  \nAlternative agreements\n \nPractical Law offers a range of services agreements. See .\n  \nLegal issues\n \nWe have set out below some of the key legal issues that typically arise when drafting an agreement for the maintenance of equipment in the B2B context.\n \nFor issues generally when considering drafting a services agreement, see .\n \n \nRelationship with hire agreement (if applicable)\n \nIf the supplier of the services is also hiring the equipment under the terms of a separate agreement, the drafter will need to consider the relationship between the two agreements. For example:\n \nAre the agreements co-terminous?\nAre the parties’ respective obligations under the two agreements consistent?\nShould service credits be on account of future hire fees?\nFor an equipment hire agreement in the B2B context, see standard documents:\n \n.\n.\n \nImplied terms\n \nThe  (SGSA) applies to B2B contracts for the supply of services or for works and materials. Part II of the SGSA implies the following three terms into such contracts:\n \nThe supplier will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill ().\nIf the time for the services is not fixed by the contract, left to be fixed in a manner agreed in the contract or determined by the parties’ course of dealing, then there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the services within a reasonable time. What is “reasonable” is a question of fact ().\nIf the price of the services is not determined by the contract, left to be determined in a manner agreed in the contract or determined by the course of dealing between the parties, then there is an implied term that the customer will pay the supplier a reasonable charge. What is “reasonable” is a question of fact ().\nIn addition, Part I of the SGSA implies the following terms in relation to goods transferred under a contract for services (for example, spare parts or materials used as part of the services, such as in contracts for work and materials):\n \nThe seller has title, the buyer will enjoy quiet possession and the goods are free from encumbrances ().\nThe goods will correspond with their description ().\nThe goods will be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose ().\nThe goods will correspond with their sample ().\nThese implied terms do not apply in relation to the finished output of the services (such as any deliverables).\n \nThe  (UCTA) controls attempts to exclude these implied terms or limit liability for their breach as follows:\n \nExclusions or limitation in relation to the implied terms as to reasonable skill and care, correspondence with description, satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and correspondence with sample must be reasonable ( and ).\nExclusions or limitations in relation to implied terms as to title, quiet possession and freedom from encumbrances are void ().\n \nLimiting liability\n \nLike any other services agreement, the limitation of liability clause in an equipment maintenance agreement is likely to be a key area of negotiation. The clause should broadly reflect the value of the agreement and the parties needs to be comfortable with the financial exposure of the liability caps (see ).\n \nIf the supplier intends to use this standard document as its standard terms, a clause limiting liability for breach of contract or by which it claims to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from what was reasonably expected of it, or to render no performance at all, will only be valid if it is reasonable (, UCTA).\n \nFor a more detailed discussion of limitation of liability clauses, see practice notes:\n \n.\n.\n.\n \nMachine-generated data\n \nThis agreement envisages the supplier providing a regular “preventative” service and then corrective and emergency services as necessary. Increasingly, equipment support agreements are driven by machine-generated data, so that the supplier only inspects the equipment when prompted to do so by the data. This has the virtue of enabling a more focused service and reducing the number of call-outs (and therefore costs savings). However, if there is machine-generated data, the parties should address:\n \nOwnership rights in the data.\nRestrictions on the use the supplier can make of the data.\nConfidentiality and security measures.\nRights to access the data.\n \nSupply chain issues\n \nEnsuring ethical practice throughout the supply chain is an issue of increasing importance to business customers. For a discussion of the key areas that could give rise to supply chain compliance requirements in the UK, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, and information security and cyber security issues, see .\n \n \nModern Slavery Act 2015\nCommercial organisations carrying on business in the UK with a global annual turnover of £36 million or more must complete a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year, setting out the steps they have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its business or in its supply chains (, Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA)). Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.\n \nFor more information on the MSA and to access materials dealing with the MSA, see .\n \nBribery Act 2010\nOf particular concern to businesses in a commercial context is the corporate offence of failure to prevent bribery by an associated person. A commercial organisation will be guilty of an offence if a person associated with it bribes another person intending to obtain or retain business for the commercial organisation, or to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for the commercial organisation (section 7, ). The commercial organisation has a defence if it can show that it had adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery by its associated persons.\n \nFor further information and an example of an anti-bribery clause, see . For background and all Practical Law materials on the Bribery Act, see .\n \nNetwork security\nThe  (NISR) apply to “essential service providers” (electricity, water supply, gas and transport) and “relevant digital service providers” (search engines, online marketplaces and cloud computing service providers). NISR require these entities to ensure that they have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to manage the risks to the security of the network and information systems on which their services rely, and to notify the competent authority within a specified time frame if there is an incident which significantly impacts the continuity of its services.\n \nA customer who is subject to NISR may want to flow down the security measures as required by NISR to the supplier. For suitable wording, see .\n  \nDrafting assumptions\n \nHire agreement. The supplier is not also hiring the equipment to the customer.\nData protection. The agreement does not involve the processing or sharing of personal data.\nMachine-generated data. There is no machine-generated data.\nIntellectual property rights. The agreement does not involve the transfer of any intellectual property rights.\nTUPE. TUPE does not apply either on entry to or exit from the agreement. See .\nUK companies. The customer and the supplier are companies incorporated in England and Wales. The customer is not a public body, so the UK rules relating to public procurement will not apply. See .\nBusiness-to-business (B2B).
