   **3.2** The Supplier shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to make the Services available and shall provide support and maintenance for the Services in accordance with its Support Policy for the relevant Services in effect at the time that the Services are provided.  The Supplier may amend the Support Policy in its sole and absolute discretion from time to time except that any such amendments shall not materially alter the support services to the Customer’s detriment. The Customer may purchase enhanced support services separately at the Supplier's then current rates..

   **3.3** The Supplier may, at its discretion, update the Software and change the operation of the Services from time to time, provided that such updates and changes shall not result in a material reduction in functionality.

         **(i)** the Supplier’s instructions;

         **(iii)** such other conditions as may be set out in the Order Details as applying to the Trial Period; and

         **(iv)** where relevant to the Trial Period, the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,

         the Supplier hereby grants to the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use (and to permit Authorised Users to use) the Services and the Documentation for the limited purposes of assessing whether to proceed to a subscription for the relevant Services; and

      **(b)** clauses 3.2 (Support), 8.1 (Supplier’s obligations) and 13.2 (Supplier’s indemnity) shall not apply to the Trial Period.

   **4.1** If there is an inconsistency between:

      **(a)** any of the provisions in these Terms and Conditions and any Order Details the Order Details shall take priority over these Terms and Conditions; and

      **(b)** the descriptions of the Services, Fees, Subscription Start Date, Initial Subscription Period, the details of any Trial Period, and other material terms relating to the Services as they (i) appear in the Documentation or (ii) are included directly in the Online Order Confirmation, the Online Order Confirmation shall take priority.

      **(f)** The Supplier’s acceptance of the Request For Services takes place when the Supplier sends the Online Order Confirmation, at which point the Agreement between the Supplier and the Customer will come into existence. The Agreement will relate only to those Services confirmed in the Online Order Confirmation.  If the Customer reasonably considers that the Online Order Confirmation does not accurately reflect its Request For Services, the Customer must inform the Supplier immediately and must not make or allow use of the Services.

      **(g)** Prior to the Supplier issuing an Online Order Confirmation for a Request For Services, the Supplier may reject the Request For Services for any reason (the “Rejected Order”).  In this situation (i) no contract shall be formed in relation to the relevant services, (ii) the Supplier will not issue an Online Order Confirmation for the Rejected Order, and (iii) if the Customer has already paid for the Rejected Order, the Supplier will refund the relevant amount paid.

   **5.3** The parties have determined that, for the purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws the Supplier shall process the Customer Personal data, as a processor on behalf of the Customer.

   **5.4** Should the determination in clause 5.3 change, then each party shall work together in good faith to make any changes which are necessary to this clause 5 or other parts of the Agreement.

   **5.5** The Customer warrants that it has an appropriate privacy policy in place in relation to the processing and collection of Customer Personal Data undertaken by the Supplier on behalf of the Customer in relation to the Services, that this has been brought to the attention of relevant data subjects and that (where required) consent has been obtained from such data subjects.

   **5.6** In relation to the Customer Personal Data, the Data Protection Particulars set out the scope, nature and purpose of processing by the Supplier, the duration of the processing and the types of personal data and categories of data subject.

   **5.7** Without prejudice to the generality of clause 5.2 the Supplier shall, in relation to Customer Personal Data:

      **(a)** process that Customer Personal Data only on the documented instructions of the Customer, which shall be to process the Customer Personal Data for the Purpose, unless the Supplier is required by applicable laws to otherwise process that Customer Personal Data. Where the Supplier is relying on a legal obligation as the basis for processing Customer Processor Data, the Supplier shall notify the Customer of this before performing the processing required by the applicable laws unless those laws prohibit the Provider from so notifying the Customer;

      **(b)** ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures, to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Customer Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Customer Personal Data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures;

      **(c)** ensure that any personnel engaged and authorised by the Supplier to process Customer Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory or common law obligation of confidentiality;

      **(d)** assist the Customer insofar as this is possible (taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the Supplier), and at the Customer's cost and written request, in responding to any request from a data subject and in ensuring the Customer's compliance with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;

      **(e)** notify the Customer without undue delay on becoming aware of a personal data breach involving the Customer Personal Data;

      **(f)** at the written direction of the Customer, delete or return Customer Personal Data and copies thereof to the Customer on termination of the Agreement unless the Supplier is required by applicable law to continue to store or to process that Customer Personal Data. For the purposes of this clause 5.7(f) Customer Personal Data shall be considered deleted where it is put beyond further use by the Supplier; and

      **(g)** maintain records to demonstrate its compliance with this clause 5 and allow for reasonable audits by the Customer or the Customer's designated auditor, for this purpose, on reasonable written notice.

         **(i)** shall ensure that the terms on which it appoints such processors comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws, and are consistent with the obligations imposed on the Supplier in this clause 5;

         **(ii)** shall remain responsible for the acts and omission of any such processor as if they were the acts and omissions of the Supplier; and

         **(iii)** shall inform the Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of the processors, thereby giving the Customer the opportunity to object to such changes provided that if the Customer objects to the changes and cannot demonstrate, to the Supplier's reasonable satisfaction, that the objection is due to an actual or likely breach of Applicable Data Protection Law, the Customer shall indemnify the Supplier for any losses, damages, costs (including legal fees) and expenses suffered by the Supplier in accommodating the objection.

      **(b)** transfer Customer Personal Data outside of the UK and EEA as required for the Purpose, provided that the Supplier shall ensure that all such transfers are effected in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

[BEGIN EXPLANATION: 6 - Third party providers]

[END EXPLANATION]

   The Customer acknowledges that the Services may enable or assist it to access the website content of, correspond with, and purchase products and services from, third parties via third-party websites and that it does so solely at its own risk. The Supplier makes no representation, warranty or commitment and shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever in relation to the content or use of, or correspondence with, any such third-party website, or any transactions completed, and any contract entered into by the Customer, with any such third party.  Any contract entered into and any transaction completed via any third-party website is between the Customer and the relevant third party, and not the Supplier.  The Supplier recommends that the Customer refers to the third party's website terms and conditions and privacy policy prior to using the relevant third-party website.

If the Services do not conform with the terms of clause 7.1, the Supplier will, at its expense, use reasonable commercial endeavours to correct any such non-conformance promptly, or provide the Customer with an alternative means of accomplishing the desired performance.

         **(i)** the Customer's use of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; or
