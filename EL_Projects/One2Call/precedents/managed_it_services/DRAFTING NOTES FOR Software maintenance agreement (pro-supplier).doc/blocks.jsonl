However, it adopts a reasonably balanced approach to the relevant issues because an agreement which is drafted too much in favour of either party serves only to increase the time and cost of negotiations. A separate standard document is available when acting for the customer (see .\n \nThe main issues arising from software maintenance contracts are discussed in . This drafting note is designed to be read in conjunction with that practice note.\n  \nLegal issues\n \n \nAssumptions\n \nThe standard document is drafted on the following assumptions:\n \nThe supported software is on-premises software, rather than SaaS. While it could be used as a basis for a maintenance agreement for , typically the level and quality of support should be higher in a SaaS set-up than in ordinary customer support and maintenance arrangements and most public cloud systems operate as a “permanent beta”, meaning that there are no manually provided versions of the software in the traditional sense. As new functionality is added or bugs are fixed, these are incorporated into the online application. This means that the application being accessed through a web browser is always the most up to date without the need for costly upgrades, and so various obligations set out in this agreement (for, example, relating to the provision of Maintenance Releases in ) will not apply. See .\nThe customer does not own any rights in the software (it uses the software under a licence). See .\nMaintenance is being provided by the owner of the rights in the software. See .\nThe parties (which are both UK limited companies). are dealing with each other in the course of their respective businesses. This means that the UK rules protecting consumers will not apply. (For more information on those rules, see .) Note that this agreement should not be used in a business-to-consumer transaction. Consumer software does not normally need to be supported; upgrades are usually offered under the customer’s licence (and made available for download from the supplier’s website), and sometimes a telephone helpline is provided for queries.\nNo employees are intended to transfer as part of the provision of maintenance services, and the  (TUPE) do not apply. If there is a risk that TUPE applies, then this should be considered carefully and the agreement amended to reflect the risk, see .\nThe standard document does not extend to hardware maintenance. For a specimen agreement that deals with hardware maintenance, see .\n \nRights in software\n \nIt is increasingly common for maintenance to be provided by third parties who do not own any rights in the software. The maintenance of software requires a licence from the software owner (or an authorised licensee with rights to sub-license) in the same way that use of the software must be licensed. Consequently, the maintainer needs to ensure either that it has an agreement with the software owner granting it the necessary rights (for example, as part of its appointment as an approved maintenance company), or that the customer is entitled to allow the maintainer to carry out work on the customer’s behalf.\n \nExcept where the customer is itself the software owner, it is unlikely that the customer will have the rights or information necessary to enable the maintainer to perform all its obligations under this standard document (at the very least, the maintainer will require access to the software owner in order to resolve technical issues), so an agreement between the software owner and the maintainer is likely to be required. To the extent that the supplier relies on the customer’s rights it should request an indemnity from the customer in case those rights prove to be illusory.\n \nAlthough a maintenance agreement for on-premises software generally includes an obligation on the maintainer to provide new releases and versions of the software (referred to in the standard document as Modifications), the maintenance agreement will not usually deal with the customer’s right to use those modifications. In other words, it does not constitute a licence of the software modifications. The standard document is drafted on the assumption that this right is contained in the licence under which the customer is given the right to use the software (referred to in the standard document as the Licence). If this were not the case, the maintenance agreement could be drafted to bring the modifications within the scope of that licence. However, where the maintainer is not the owner of the rights in the software, it is unlikely to have the rights to license the use of the modifications; its licence will normally be limited to supplying the media on which those modifications are recorded. In order to prevent it incurring any liability in those cases, a third-party maintainer should, before signature, satisfy itself that the customer does have a licence to use the modifications to the software which the maintainer has an obligation to provide.\n \nLimits of liability\n \nThe supplier should seek to limit its liability to the customer under the maintenance agreement as, otherwise, it could face liability which far exceeds the sums it receives under the agreement if it is unable to provide an adequate level of service. Customers will usually accept some form of exclusion and limitation of liability, but suppliers need to draft such terms carefully so that they comply with the provisions of the  (UCTA), where this applies, see . See also .\n \nOff-shoring\n \nThe specimen agreement assumes that the contract will be performed in the UK. However, most maintenance services can now be provided remotely so suppliers will often wish to subcontract performance to individuals situated off-shore (for example, in India). These individuals may be employees of the supplier but will more likely be employees of a subsidiary or subcontractor. From a customer’s point of view this potentially gives rise to a number of concerns, including:\n \nData protection. The wording of both the  (and where it applies, the ) is broad, and an off-shore engineer who accesses a UK system containing personal data for maintenance purposes may carry out operations that could be considered to constitute transferring personal data outside the UK. Unless there is to be an absolute prohibition on any processing being carried out off-shore, the parties will need to consider how transfers of personal data out of the UK (and where EU legislation applies, the EU) can be undertaken in compliance with the relevant data protection legislation. For more information on this topic see .\nSecurity. As part of any risk assessment for security purposes the supplier will wish to consider the procedures it has in place to protect unauthorised access to data, screen its employees for security purposes, prevent removal of data from customer systems, and so on. The supplier will then need to consider whether this security risk is being managed in line with any statutory or contractual obligations the supplier is under in relation to data protection or cybersecurity more generally, see  and .\nReputation. All suppliers who send services off-shore need to consider whether the manner in which their off-shore suppliers carry on business is consistent with their ethical and environmental standards. Many large off-shore vendors in the IT industry are only too aware of these concerns and are able to demonstrate high levels of compliance to their customers, but a supplier whose maintenance contract may include off-shore support (and many will) should consider these issues.\n \nAnti-bribery\n \nBoth customers and suppliers need to comply with the  (BA 2010). However, whether or not to include appropriate anti-bribery clauses in the relevant agreement is primarily an issue for the customer, rather than the supplier, to consider. The customer may be liable under  of the BA 2010 for failure to prevent bribery by or on behalf of the supplier and inclusion of appropriate clauses may help it establish the defence that it has adequate procedures in place designed to prevent bribery by its associated persons. The supplier will not generally face a similar risk on account of the customer’s activities. Nevertheless, the supplier will, for example, need to consider whether to include appropriate clauses in any related subcontract or consultancy agreement which it may enter into for the acquisition of services or goods. For more information, see Practice note,  .\n \nFor more information about issues potentially affecting the supplier under the BA 2010, see Supplier issues\n \nSupply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking\n \nThe  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.\n \nThe supplier should note that the customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the supplier will comply with the customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the supplier may require the customer to comply with the supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.\n \nFor further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .\n \nData protection\n \nWhere  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at  or, alternatively, as part of a data protection schedule to be annexed to this agreement.\n \nThe clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.\n \nFor some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:\n \n.\n.\nEach set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.\n \nFor a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .\n \nCybersecurity\n \nCybersecurity obligations are becoming more prominent in IT agreements, including as statutory controls and obligations in relation to network and information system, and data, security are increasing, see:\n \n;\n:\n.\nFor more information on conducting cybersecurity risk assessments, see  and for more information about managing cyber risk in an organisation’s supply chain, see .\n \n \nNIS Regulations\nThe predominant cybersecurity legislation to consider is the  (NIS Regulations), which came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the ) (also known as the Network and Information Systems, or NIS Directive).\n \nThey have potential impact on:\n \nAny operator of essential services that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure (OES).\nRelevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).\nFor a definition of an OES see  and for a definition of an RDSP see .\n \nLike the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems. In practice, however, the two regimes are inextricably linked.\n \nOESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OESs).\n \nYou will need to assess whether your agreement is affected by the NIS Regulations, either directly, because one of the parties falls within the scope of the NIS Regulations, or indirectly, because your agreement is further up a supply chain that includes an entity within the scope of those regulations.\n \nDuring maintenance the customer and supplier systems are likely to interface with each other. The supplier is likely to have access to personal data (for example, customer data) stored on the customer systems at some point. Data will likely flow in both directions and a significant security breach will have compliance consequences under both the UK GDPR (if the data in question is personal data) and the NIS Regulations (if the customer is an OES or RDSP).\n \nIn that case, the customer may ask for a warranty in relation to the supplier’s network security levels, and in relation to its cooperation in relation to the customer’s regulatory obligations and any security incident. An example of the types of clauses the customer might ask for is set out in , including in . It might be reasonable to agree to such provisions, and in fact the supplier may have developed comprehensive processes and policies to support the services it provides (particularly if it is subject to the NIS Regulations as an RDSP itself). However, the supplier should in return ask for a warranty or some form of approval that the information the supplier provides is sufficient for the customer to meet its obligations under the NIS Regulations.\n \nThe National Cyber Security Centre has published  which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances.\n \nThere may also be specific guidance issued by the regulator for the specific OES sector or, for RDSPs, the ICO.\n \nFor more information on regulation in this area, see \n \nTUPE\n \nThere is a possibility that a  transfer could occur at the end of a maintenance agreement. This could arise where the support and maintenance services are taken in-house or are re-tendered to a different supplier. Whether there is a risk of TUPE applying is highly fact dependant and would involve a consideration of the usual aspects of the test for a service provision change (see ). One of the key questions is likely to be whether the activities to be carried out following the end of this agreement will be fundamentally the same as those carried out under this agreement (see ). It will also be relevant to consider whether certain of the maintenance staff have been dedicated wholly or substantially to supporting the customer in question (see ). The customer will likely want to insert TUPE clauses which deal with the position on exit. From the customer’s perspective, the exit provisions are intended to anticipate the future commercial considerations and the position of a subsequent supplier (with a view to extending protections to a subsequent supplier). The supplier, on the hand, is likely to seek entry provisions to deal with the risk of a TUPE transfer on entry\n \nThe form of the clauses and the context is very much the same as found in outsourcing agreements and, accordingly, they have not been replicated in this standard document.\n \nFor more information, see  and  which have a slightly pro-customer leaning, but the provisions should be reviewed in detail, with reference to the drafting notes, to suit the circumstances.\n  \nNegotiating and drafting issues\n \nThe standard document has been drafted to accompany the following Standard documents:\n \n.\n.\nIt could also form Appendix B to either of these documents.\n \n \nStandardised services\n \nThe standard document may be used as the supplier’s standard maintenance contract or on a one-off basis for a particular customer. Where it is the supplier’s standard, changes to the scope of the services should be resisted since it might be difficult for the supplier to manage its obligations where they vary from customer to customer.\n \nService levels and service credits\n \nService levels have been included within the standard document as many service obligations are difficult to define without reference to a particular level of service, for example, a two hour response time. Service credits, however, have been omitted from the standard document. (If required by the customer, they can be found in , and there is also a more detailed discussion of service credits in .) The supplier should consider carefully whether to include service credits in a standard form. There are two main reasons why the inclusion of the supplier’s own scheme might be advisable:\n \nIf it does not include a service credits regime, the customer may include its own, less favourable, scheme.\nCustomers will often agree that service credits are the customer’s exclusive remedy for the faults they cover and, provided the service credits are at a reasonable level, this can be more beneficial to the supplier than a claim for damages at large.\nThis second consideration is particularly applicable where the maintenance provider is also the licensor under a separate licence. In the absence of an easy claim under a service credit regime, a disgruntled customer may consider launching a more significant claim under the licence and/or maintenance agreement.\n \nFor a discussion of other relevant drafting and negotiating issues, see .\n  \nDrafting for Brexit\n \nOn 31 January 2020 (), the UK left the EU and the  entered into force.
