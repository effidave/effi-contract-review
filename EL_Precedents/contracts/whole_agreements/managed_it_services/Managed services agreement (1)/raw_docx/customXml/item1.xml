            <para>
              <paratext>This managed services agreement is drafted slightly in favour of the Supplier. It draws on elements from application service provision agreements and also from outsourcing contracts. It is intended for use where the Supplier will provide a service consisting of the integrated management of personnel, equipment, materials, software and telecoms services and is most likely to be appropriate for medium-sized deals (that is, where the Customer will retain an in-house capability of its own, or where the managed service itself, whilst important to the Customer, is not, in and of itself, absolutely business critical).</paratext>
            </para>
            <para>
              <paratext>The agreement can be used for telecoms infrastructure-sharing arrangements where the management of the infrastructure is outsourced.  However, if the arrangement is simply to share equipment, such as base stations, this agreement will not be appropriate.</paratext>
            </para>
            <para>
              <paratext>On more complex transactions, especially those where there will be a transfer of staff, where the Supplier will be undertaking a complex transition and then transformation programme, or where many jurisdictions and affiliates are involved, it will probably be necessary to add some additional provisions. For more information and resources that may be more appropriate for complex transactions, see the following Standard documents:</paratext>

It should be made clear whether the Customer is entitled to use the output of that first phase to procure the second phase from an alternative supplier.</paratext>

                    <paratext>These standard terms do not deal with any issues arising out of the <link href="2-505-5915" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>TUPE Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/246)</ital></link> (TUPE).

                    <paratext>It is difficult to prescribe a single approach to dealing with employees on commencement of the services and on exit for all situations. It is often advisable for the agreement to address TUPE on both entry and exit, even where it is not anticipated that TUPE will apply, in case the parties’ analysis of whether TUPE applies is incorrect or there is a change in law or interpretation during the term of the agreement; however this will depend on the particular circumstances and whether the agreement is to be supplier-friendly or customer-friendly.</paratext>

                  <para>
                    <paratext>If TUPE indemnities are provided on entry, the usual commercial approach is that these are mirrored on exit. Remaining silent on entry and exit and allowing TUPE to take its course may be beneficial to the party who is the transferor at that particular stage as all the liabilities would pass to the transferee. Therefore, it may be beneficial for a Customer to have no TUPE provisions on entry as generally employees and liabilities will pass to the Supplier, but the corollary is that the Customer will not have the benefit of TUPE indemnities on exit if the services are taken back in house or if it is asked to indemnify a replacement Supplier.</paratext>

                  <para>
                    <paratext>It is becoming more common to see a “blanket indemnity” on entry and exit under which the transferor indemnifies the transferee against all liabilities in relation to employees and employment-related liabilities that transfer under TUPE, so that if any employees transfer, the transferee can terminate their employment and the transferor will pick up all liabilities (provided that their employment is terminated within a finite period). Such indemnities are often requested where the transferee does not want to inherit any employees or where it is considered that TUPE will not apply to the provision of the services or the termination of the services.</paratext>

The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps.

                <paratext>The Supplier should note that the Customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the Supplier will comply with the Customer's policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies, too, such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the Supplier may require the Customer to comply with the Supplier's business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.</paratext>

In summary, the Supplier has an obligation to prepare and then implement a project plan with the Customer. Before beginning the managed service, there will be a transfer of equipment, Third-Party Software, Customer Software and other intellectual property to the Supplier.

                          <paratext>Under the first option in <internal.reference refid="a920425"><ital>clause 16.2</ital></internal.reference> all IPR in anything specifically developed for the Customer is owned by the Supplier. Strictly speaking, this clause is not necessary, since the starting point is that IPR is owned by the entity which created it. However, a court may imply an assignment to the Customer if this is necessary to give effect to the underlying commercial bargain and in any event it is sensible to ensure that both parties have common understanding of IPR ownership and licence position. If this option is selected, then <internal.reference refid="a607587"><ital>clause 16.3</ital></internal.reference> should be omitted. In this case, the Supplier's licence of IPR to the Customer (<internal.reference refid="a318281"><ital>clause 16.5</ital></internal.reference>) will comprise both the IPR specifically developed by the Supplier for the Customer and the Supplier's pre-existing IPR, and the Customer's licence to the Supplier (<internal.reference refid="a280836"><ital>clause 16.6</ital></internal.reference>) will relate only to the Customer's pre-existing IPR.</paratext>

                        <para>
                          <paratext>If the Customer uses the second option in <internal.reference refid="a920425"><ital>clause 16.2</ital></internal.reference>, all the remaining sub-clauses will be relevant. In this scenario, the Customer will own all IPR in the Work Product developed specifically for the Customer. <internal.reference refid="a513122"><ital>Clause 16.2(b)</ital></internal.reference> contains wording required for a present assignment of future rights under <link href="8-508-8574" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>section 91, Copyright, Designs and Patents Act</ital></link>. Where the present assignment of future rights works, nothing more should be required. Consequently, further steps should only be necessary under <internal.reference refid="a607587"><ital>clause 16.3</ital></internal.reference> if the Supplier or sub-contractor defaults (or the Supplier fails to include the appropriate wording in its sub-contract), so it is reasonable that the Supplier bears the cost of any extra documentation and so on that is required under <internal.reference refid="a607587"><ital>clause 16.3</ital></internal.reference>. When the second option is chosen, the licence granted to the Customer by the Supplier in <internal.reference refid="a318281"><ital>clause 16.5</ital></internal.reference> will relate only to the Supplier’s pre-existing IPR. The Customer’s licence to the Supplier (<internal.reference refid="a280836"><ital>clause 16.6</ital></internal.reference>) will comprise both the Customer’s pre-existing IPR and the IPR in the Work Product transferred to the Customer. The licence to the Supplier of the Customer's IPR (<internal.reference refid="a280836"><ital>clause 16.6</ital></internal.reference>) only needs to last for the term of the agreement and to permit use for the purposes of providing products and services to the Customer, as the Supplier may only use such IPR for the purpose of performing the agreement. In contrast, if the Supplier's pre-existing IPR is key to the Customer’s use of the Work Product and this is embedded in the Customer's ongoing business, the Customer may want its rights to use the Supplier's pre-existing IPR to continue after the expiry or termination of the agreement. Describing the licence as perpetual and irrevocable should mean that it is harder for the Supplier to terminate the licence for the Customer's breach, but even if so described the Customer probably cannot eliminate entirely the possibility that the licence can be terminated if the Customer commits a very serious beach or persistent and material breaches.</paratext>

This may be preferable to relying on the inclusion or exclusion of "indirect loss" or "loss of profit", given the considerable degree of uncertainty and constantly evolving case law about the scope of indirect loss and loss of profit. For example, a new clause might specify that, notwithstanding <internal.reference refid="a536212"><ital>clause 19.5(a)</ital></internal.reference>, the Supplier is (or, alternatively, without prejudice to the generality of clause 19.5(a), the Supplier is not), responsible for the reasonable costs incurred by the Customer in engaging third-party consultants to monitor the Supplier's performance following a material breach of this agreement.

                    <paratext>It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to delete electronic data. The word ‘deletion’, and its variants, can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK's data protection authority) has opined that the term "deletion", in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.</paratext>

In situations where audit is more important, Customers can ask for further provisions here, for example a mechanism to claw back audit costs if an audit reveals a breach of contract by the Supplier. The Supplier may want to limit the number and frequency of audits which (notwithstanding <internal.reference refid="a711028"><ital>clause 23.4</ital></internal.reference>) can be disruptive, in which case the Customer may want to remove or vary such limits if an audit reveals a breach of contract.

                    <paratext>However, the BA 2010 Guidance (<ital>Guidance about procedures which relevant commercial organisations can put in place to prevent persons associated with them from bribing (section 9 of the Bribery Act 2010</ital>), published by the Ministry of Justice) suggests that where a supply chain involves several entities, or a project is to be performed by a prime contractor with a series of sub-contractors, a commercial organisation is only likely to exercise control over its relationship with its direct contractual counterparty (<ital>paragraph 39, BA 2010 Guidance</ital>). Indeed, the organisation may only know the identity of its direct contractual counterparty, and not those further down the supply chain. In this situation, according to the guidance, it is likely that persons who contract with that counterparty will be performing services for the counterparty and not for other persons in the contractual chain (that is, the ultimate Customer), suggesting that the Customer will <bold>not</bold> be liable for bribery committed by its Supplier's sub-contractors.</paratext>

                    <paratext>The BA 2010 Guidance recommends that the principal way in which commercial organisations may approach bribery risks that arise as a result of a supply chain is by employing the anti-bribery procedures as proposed in the BA 2010 Guidance (for example, risk-based due diligence and the use of anti-bribery terms and conditions) in its relationship with its contractual counterparty and requesting that the counterparty adopt a similar approach with the next person in the chain.

With regard to the technical support services provided by the Supplier, it may be important to try to ensure that the Customer and the Supplier agree on a fault priority together, with some sort of mechanism for determining any dispute. A possible solution to this problem is to require the Supplier to treat the priority in accordance with the Customer's own designation, and then allow the Supplier the option of charging the Customer its incremental costs of resolution if formal dispute resolution ultimately finds that the Supplier was correct in the first place.</paratext>

However, the relevant regulator for the sector in which the OES operates may have published more specific guidance and OESs must have regard to such guidance (<ital>regulation 10(4)</ital>) as well as the NCSC guidance.
