No rights or licences are conferred on the Licensee pursuant to this licence except those expressly set out in this licence.
Quality control and marking
The Licensee shall comply with the specifications, standards and directions relating to the Licensed Products as notified in writing by the Licensor from time to time and with all applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice.
The Licensee shall promptly provide the Licensor with copies of all communications, relating to the Intellectual Property Rights or the Licensed Products, with any regulatory, industry or other authority.
The Licensee shall procure that all Licensed Products sold by the Licensee and all descriptive literature relating to the Licensed Products be marked with:
a notice in the following terms:
© Copyright [LICENSOR] [YEAR] manufactured by [LICENSEE] under licence from [LICENSOR]; and

Payment
On the Effective Date the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor the sum of £[AMOUNT]. 
The payment made by the Licensee under clause 4.1 is exclusive of VAT. If the payment constitutes the whole or any part of the consideration for a taxable or deemed taxable supply by the Licensor, the Licensee shall increase the payment by an amount equal to the VAT which is chargeable in respect of the taxable or deemed taxable supply in question, provided that the Licensor shall have delivered a valid VAT invoice in respect of such VAT to the Licensee. If any VAT invoice is delivered to the Licensee after the payment has been made, the Licensee shall pay the VAT due within five Business Days of the Licensor delivering a valid VAT invoice, a Business Day being a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in England when banks in London are open for business.

If any such withholding or deduction is required by law, the Licensee shall, when making the payment to which the withholding or deduction relates, pay to the Licensor such additional amount as will ensure that the Licensor receives the same total amount that it would have received if no such withholding or deduction had been required.
In the event of any delay in paying the sum due under clause 4.1 by the due date, the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor:
interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [4]% per annum above [FULL NAME OF BANK]'s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Licensee shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount; and
an amount equal to any penalties incurred by the Licensor as a direct result of the delay.
The provisions of this clause 4 shall remain in effect notwithstanding termination or expiry of this agreement until the settlement of all subsisting claims by the Licensor.
Indemnity
[In this clause:
Applicable Laws: means all applicable laws, statutes, regulations [and codes] from time to time in force.
Losses: means all liabilities, damages, losses (including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of reputation, loss of savings and loss of opportunity), fines, expenses and costs (including all interest, penalties, legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and [reasonable] professional costs and expenses).
Regulator: means each person having regulatory or supervisory authority over all or any part of this agreement or [Party 1's OR any Indemnified Person's] business.]
The Licensee shall indemnify the Licensor against all Losses incurred by the Licensor as a result of:
[[any claim by a third party arising out of or in connection with] defective Licensed Products supplied by the Licensee[, to the extent that the defect is attributable to the acts or omissions of the Licensee;]
[any damage to property arising out of or in connection with the acts or omissions of the Licensee;]
[any action (including any investigation) by a Regulator or governmental authority arising out of or in connection with the Licensee's [acts or omissions OR breach of this agreement, negligence or failure to comply with Applicable Laws in the performance of this agreement];]
[the Licensee's exercise of its rights granted under this agreement; ]
the enforcement of this agreement; or
[any breach of clause [NUMBER] of this agreement. ]
The indemnity in clause 5.2 applies whether or not the Licensor has been negligent or at fault.
If any third party brings a claim against the Licensor, or notifies the Licensor of its intention to do so, and that claim may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under an indemnity (Claim), the Licensor shall:
as soon as reasonably practicable, give written notice of the Claim to the Licensee, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;
[subject to clause 5.5,] allow the Licensee, at the Licensee's cost, to conduct all negotiations and proceedings in relation to the Claim and to settle or compromise the Claim, provided that the Licensee must not settle or compromise the Claim [without the prior written consent of the Licensor (consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) OR unless it involves only the payment of money by the Licensee and includes a complete release of the Licensor;
not[, subject to clause 5.5 and the Licensee's full compliance with clause 5.6,] make any admission of liability, settlement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Licensee [(that consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed)] [, provided that the Licensor may settle the Claim (after giving prior written notice of the terms of settlement (to the extent legally possible) to the Licensee, but without obtaining the Licensee's consent), if the Licensor [reasonably] believes that failure to settle the Claim would be prejudicial to it in any material respect]; and
provide the Licensee with reasonable information, assistance and co-operation in responding to and defending the Claim[, subject to the Licensee's compliance with clause 5.6(c)]. [This duty includes the Licensor giving the Licensee [and the Licensee's professional advisers] access at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to:
its premises and those of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers involved in the Claim; and 
any relevant accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Licensor, 
so that the Licensee [and the Licensee's professional advisers] can examine them and take copies (at the Licensee's expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim.
If the Licensee does not assume control over the defence of a Claim [within [NUMBER] days of OR promptly following] receipt of the notice under clause 5.4(a), the Licensor may defend the Claim in any way it deems appropriate at the Licensee's expense.
If the Licensee assumes control over the defence of any Claim, the Licensee shall:
defend the Claim diligently, using competent counsel and in such a way as not to bring the reputation of the Licensor into disrepute;
have regard to the interests and reputation of the Licensor in its conduct of the Claim;
reimburse the Licensor for any costs incurred under clause 5.4(d);
ensure that the Licensor is granted access to all relevant documents connected with the Claim and keep the Licensor informed, at regular intervals, regarding negotiations, litigation and other material matters concerning the Claim; and
[comply with all reasonable directions given by the Licensor in relation to the Claim OR allow the Licensor to join in the defence of the Claim with counsel of its choice at its own expense.]
The failure of the Licensor to comply with the indemnification procedures in clause 5.4 does not relieve the Licensee of any obligation to indemnify the Licensor. 
If a payment due from the Licensee under clause 5.2 is subject to tax (whether by way of direct assessment or withholding at its source), the amount of the payment shall be increased to ensure that the net receipt, after tax, to the Licensor is the same as it would have been were the payment not subject to tax.
[[Nothing in this clause requires the Licensor to mitigate any Losses it may claim under an indemnity].]
[[Liability under the indemnity is unlimited].]
Protection of the Intellectual Property Rights
