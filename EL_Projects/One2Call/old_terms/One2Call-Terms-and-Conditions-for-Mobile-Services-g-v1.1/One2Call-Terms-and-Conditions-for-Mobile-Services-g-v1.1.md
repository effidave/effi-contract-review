# One2Call Terms and Conditions for Mobile Services

   YOUR AGREEMENT WITH US (this “AGREEMENT”) IS MADE UP OF THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS:

   **(i)** THESE CONDITIONS FOR MOBILE SERVICES;

   **(ii)** THE CONDITIONS FOR COMMUNICATION SERVICES;

   **(iii)** THE SERVICE AGREEMENT;

   **(iv)** THE RELEVANT TARIFF FOR THE SERVICES WE AGREE TO PROVIDE TO YOU; AND

   **(v)** ANY FURTHER CONDITIONS RELATING TO SPECIFIC SERVICES.

      THE SERVICES AND USE OF THE SERVICES

1 Provision of the Services

   1.1 We are providing you with mobile Services using approved Equipment, SIM Cards and network resources. 1.2 These Conditions are the terms on which you may use the Services, Equipment and Software.

   1.3 Services will be provided within ours and our partners' network areas in the UK and by roaming on to other networks.

   1.4 You agree that we, any network provider and our hardware suppliers can process your organisation’s information, which we collect or which you submit to us during any sales or registration process, for a number of purposes, including to open and manage an account for Services, to deliver products and services ordered by you, for security and emergency service support, for credit checking and fraud prevention, and for product analysis and direct marketing as set out in our ‘Privacy Notice’.

   1.5 This Agreement and your obligations under this Agreement will commence on the date you sign the service agreement (which may include electronic signature by accepting our proposal via our online ordering system).  The duration of this Agreement will commence from the Connection Date(s) of each number.  Our obligations under this agreement will commence on the Connection Date. 1.6 Where we agree to renew your Agreement during the Minimum Term, unless otherwise agreed with you in writing, the duration of the new Agreement for each individual Connection(s) will commence the day after the expiry of the current Minimum Term on each Connection.

2 Phone number and SIM

   2.1 SIM Cards shall remain the property of

   One2Call Ltd at all times and you shall be entitled to use the SIM Cards (including any Software they contain) provided for use with the Services only.

   2.2 You warrant that SIM Cards are only used with your authorisation and you will inform us as soon as is reasonably practicable after you become aware that a SIM Card is lost, stolen or damaged.  Subject to clause 7.1 you shall be liable for any loss or damage suffered by you as a result of unauthorised use of SIM Cards (including due to loss or theft), up to the time that you have notified us that such SIM Card is being used without your authorisation.  Following such notification the SIM card will be barred for all usage but we are unable to bar the equipment itself unless the equipment was provided by us. You will be liable for all costs until such time you request the bar to be placed.

   2.3 We shall allocate telephone numbers to you which you shall only use to access the Services.  We may reallocate or change such telephone numbers as a result of changes in applicable law or instructions from any regulatory authorities, but will exercise all reasonable endeavours to minimise any disruption to you.  We may withdraw telephone numbers that have been allocated to you as a result of your failure to comply with this Agreement.

   2.4 If you decide to Port a mobile telephone number allocated to you by One2Call or our partners, we shall, subject to clause 18, release your mobile telephone numbers for your nominated mobile network operator to transfer in accordance with OFCOM regulations.

   2.5 Each SIM may only be used in equipment which are enabled for Services and are authorised by us for Connection to our network.  Any attempt to use the SIM in other equipment may result in serious damage to the equipment and may prevent you from being able to use it, including the making of emergency Calls.  In these instances, we or any network provider are not responsible for any such damage or usage problems.

3 Services and Coverage

   3.1 Once you are Connected and Activated, we shall use reasonable endeavours to provide you with the Services and to ensure the security of your communications at all times.  However, due to the nature of mobile technology, it is impossible to provide a fault-free service and it is always possible that the quality or coverage may be affected at times. 3.2 We shall use reasonable endeavours to give you access to Overseas Networks; however, we shall not be responsible for the performance of Overseas Networks or any part of the network not controlled by us or our partners. Overseas Networks may be limited in quality and coverage, and access and service availability depends on the arrangements with overseas operators. We will notify you of any terms of access (if any) that you need to comply with to use Overseas Networks.

   3.3 You will be able to upload and send your own content using the Services.  You grant us and any network providers a royalty-free, perpetual and worldwide licence to store, transmit or otherwise deal with any content you upload on the Services.

   3.4 We may:

   **(a)** change or withdraw some, or part, of the Services from time to time.  This may be because of changing technologies, obsolescence, new or different product features, changing content providers or the need to remove, replace or modify content; and

   **(b)** determine or change how Services are presented and delivered to the equipment or are otherwise made available to you.

      **3.5** Where we provide you with any usage alerts, you accept that these are on a reasonable endeavors basis and we have no liability should we, for any reason, fail to send or be late in sending or you fail to receive for any reason such usage alert and you agree you will remain liable for all usage costs incurred whether we alerted you to such usage or not.

      **3.6** Where you opt in to an international roaming bolt on you accept you are agreeing to opt out of any automatic barring (including any European regulatory barring) and agree to pay for all roamed usage outside of any bundle allowance. 3.7 Where you opt to take any automatic top up bundle you accept there will be no limit to the amount of times the bundle will auto top up and you agree you will be liable for all automatic top up charges.

4 Limitation of Services

   4.1 We will always try to make Services available to you.  However, Services are only available within our coverage area.  Within this, there may be areas where you do not have access to all Services or where coverage is otherwise limited or unavailable.

   4.2 Where you take the MultiNet Service, should coverage on our Primary Access Network be unavailable at any time, your SIM Card will automatically pick up Alternative Access Networks as may be available in your location.  Should you be on a call at the time the call will terminate whilst your SIM Card connects to an Alternative Access Network.  Where coverage on our Primary Access Network becomes available again your SIM Card will automatically revert to this network, this will not happen whilst you are on a call unless coverage on the Alternative Access Network becomes unavailable.  We do not guarantee you will always have access to an Alternative Access Network and this is subject to coverage available in your location at the time.  There may be a delay while your SIM Card connects to either our Primary Access Network or an Alternative Access Network.

5 Disruption to Services

   5.1 There may be situations when Services are not continuously available or the quality is affected and so we cannot guarantee continuous fault-free service.  For instance (a) when we or any network provider need to perform upgrading, maintenance or other work on the network or Services;

   **(b)** when you move outside our coverage area whilst you are on a Call (in this case Calls may not be maintained);

   **(c)** when you are in areas otherwise not covered by our network;

   **(d)** during any technical failure of the network; (e) when it is necessary to safeguard the security and integrity of the network or to reduce the incidence of fraud; (f) where Artificially Inflated Traffic has been identified;

   **(g)** due to Emergency Planning Measures; or

   **(h)** because of other factors outside our control, such as the features or functionality of your handset, regulatory requirements, lack of capacity, interruptions to services from other suppliers, faults in other communication networks, the weather or radio interference caused by  hills, tunnels or other physical obstructions.

      We shall endeavour to keep all such disruptions to a minimum and shall give you notice of such disruptions where reasonably practicable.

6 Suspension of Services

   6.1 We may Suspend any or all of the Services you use immediately and without notice, compensation or liability to you if:

   **(a)** we reasonably believe you have provided us with

      false or misleading details about yourself;

   **(b)** we advise you that your excessive use of Services (as may be defined within these Conditions or within fair usage policies as may be published from time to time) is causing problems for other users, and you are continuing to use Services excessively;

   **(c)** we believe your equipment or SIM Card has been lost or stolen;

   **(d)** we reasonably believe that you have used Services, the SIM Card or a phone number for illegal or improper purposes or to make Nuisance Calls in contravention of our responsible use requirements within these Conditions;

   **(e)** we receive a serious complaint against you which we believe to be genuine (for example, if we receive a complaint that you are using Services in any of the ways prohibited).  If this happens, we will deal with the complaint in the manner set out in clause 18;

   **(f)** we are required to Suspend your Services by the emergency services or other government authorities; (g) we reasonably believe you are using the Service for a voice over internet protocol service or similar service that is not authorized by us;

   **(h)** where a SIM Card has been inactive for two

      consecutive quarters;

   **(i)** we reasonably suspect you are using a GSM Gateway;

   **(j)** your usage is adversely affecting the operation of the mobile network or provision of the mobile services; (k) your usage is or may adversely affect the operation of the mobile network or any third party network or provision of the mobile services or the provision of services by us to any other person;

      (l)we suspect fraudulent, criminal or illegal activities are being carried out, or are likely to be carried out.

      6.2 If we Suspend any or all of your Services, you will still be able to make emergency Calls (unless they have been Suspended at the request of the emergency services).

      6.3 If your Services are Suspended, we may agree to reConnect you if you ask us to do so and there may be a reConnection Charge for this.

      6.4 If your Services are Suspended you will remain liable for all charges under this Agreement.

7.Equipment

   7.1  We shall bear the risk of loss or damage to Equipment and SIM Cards provided by us until the point of delivery to you.  Subject to clause 7.2, you shall bear the risk of loss or damage to Equipment and SIM Cards from the time the delivery is made and the delivery note or system is signed. You do not have the right to return any Equipment unless there is a proven fault with the Equipment.  We are unable to exchange Equipment once delivery has been accepted.

   7.2 You shall notify us in writing within 24 hours of receipt if Equipment or SIM Cards arrive having been damaged, or if the order has been incorrectly fulfilled.  You shall notify us in writing within 10 working days of confirmation of our order acceptance if you do not receive the Equipment or SIM Card and following such notification, we shall replace damaged new Equipment or SIM Cards, Equipment lost or stolen in transit free of charge.  You shall notify us in writing within 10 working days of receipt if Equipment does not operate (dead on arrival) and following such notification, we shall replace the dead on arrival Equipment as soon as reasonably practicable.

   7.3  Subject to clause 2.1, title to Equipment shall pass to you as soon as we have received payment for it in full.  Where Equipment is free of charge, title shall pass on delivery.  For the avoidance of doubt, title in SIM Cards shall remain with us.

   7.4 Where Equipment supplied to you by us becomes faulty for reasons other than through your acts, omissions or misuse within the manufacturer’s warranty period, you shall return such Equipment to us at our cost and we shall replace the Equipment in accordance with our returns policy as applicable at the time.  The returns policy may vary depending on your handset, and some handsets are completely excluded from our returns policy.  Any out-of-warranty replacements shall be at our Tariff applicable at the time.  Should we agree to a repair or a replacement, you must ensure that you back-up or otherwise store separately any of your information or other data on the handset which you may require, as this will be lost during the repair or replacement process.  We are not responsible for any information or data which may be lost during the repair or replacement process.

   7.5 We do not manufacture Equipment and save for clause 7.4 above exclude, to the fullest extent permissible at law, all warranties, terms or conditions in relation to Equipment, whether implied by law or otherwise. We shall pass on the benefit of any warranties that we obtain from the manufacturer of any Equipment supplied to you by us.  However, on expiry of this Agreement, any commitment that we have to liaise with the manufacturer in respect of any warranty shall cease.

   7.6  You shall not remove or obscure any logo or writing on Equipment that we have supplied to you and which you do not own.  You shall replace all batteries and other consumable parts of the Equipment.  You shall not, and shall ensure that End Users do not tamper with or attempt to repair or service the Equipment or allow any party other than us to do so. Any attempt to do this may invalidate the manufacturer’s warranty.  You shall keep all Equipment that we have supplied and which you do not own, in your possession and shall not sell it, place a charge on it or otherwise dispose of it.

   7.7 Our supply of Equipment shall be subject to availability.

   7.8 Equipment which can be used to access Services may be locked to the network.  The software in the Equipment and all intellectual property rights in that software are owned by the Equipment manufacturer and you are being allowed to use the software on a limited licence from the Equipment manufacturer.  On expiry of your Agreement with us should you wish to unlock your Equipment to use with another network, this will be your responsibility.

   7.9 Should you take a SIM-only Tariff from us to use with your existing Equipment then the unlocking of your Equipment will be your responsibility and you agree that we shall not be liable for any direct or indirect costs as a result of you unlocking your Equipment to use with our SIM Cards.

   7.10 All replacement Equipment shall be subject to stock availability and we reserve the right to supply replacement Equipment of a similar specification where necessary.

   7.11 If you will be using your existing BlackBerry

   Enterprise Server (BES) or BlackBerry Enterprise Express Server (BESX), it should be noted that we will not support this in any way.

8.Orders and Charges

   8.1 Orders are binding on both parties from the date of acceptance by us.  If acceptance is not expressed, it shall be deemed to have occurred on dispatch of Equipment or our activation of your Service.  For the avoidance of doubt, if you do not ask us to activate your Service then we will activate your Service within 10 working days of receipt of your order, unless we agree otherwise with you in writing, from which point you will become liable for all Charges and the Minimum Term will commence from that date.

   8.2 Where you choose to take a Bundle as your Tariff all Call types not included in the Bundle and Calls included in the Bundle that exceed the allowance will be chargeable at our standard pricing, or as otherwise agreed in writing.

   8.3 All Bundles, metered and unmetered Tariffs are subject to our fair use policy which will be as detailed in our Tariff documentation or your proposal or your Service Agreement.

   8.4 Unless otherwise specified in the Tariff, bolt ons must be added at the point of Connection and shall apply for the duration of the Agreement and cannot be removed mid-term. Bolt ons removed mid-term will be liable for early termination charges.

   8.5 Downward Tariff migrations (where a change in Tariff results in a lower line rental) are permitted once during the Agreement term in conjunction with a mid-term renewal and you may only migrate down one Tariff step.

   8.6 Charges for international roaming Services shall be made available to you after such Charges have been received by us.  Due to the nature of roamed usage they may be invoiced to you several months in arrears and there shall be no time restriction on the invoicing of such usage and standard payment terms shall apply to these Charges.

   8.7 Notwithstanding clause 8.6, Charges for all mobile usage may be invoiced up to 12 months in arrears and standard payment terms shall apply to these Charges.

   8.8 Where you are offered a Hardware Fund as part of

   your Tariff, such fund shall only be available for the duration of the initial Minimum Term.  Your Hardware Fund may only be used to purchase Equipment from us.  However, you may take some of your allocated Hardware Fund as a credit against your account only if agreed with us in writing in advance.  Should you fail to use your Hardware Fund within the initial Minimum Term any remaining balance will not be carried forward.

9.Software Licence

   9.1 Equipment and Services provided under this Agreement may contain or use Software.  This Software is generally not owned by us.  Any Software that is used by our Equipment or Services shall be governed by the terms of the relevant Software licence provided with the relevant Equipment or Service.  In all other cases, where Software is provided we grant you a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to use any such Software for the duration of this Agreement.

   9.2 Your licence shall be a single user licence. You may make one copy of the Software for back up purposes.  If you do not accept the terms of the relevant Software licence, you shall be prohibited from using the relevant feature of the Service to which the Software relates and we shall not be bound to deliver the relevant Service. You shall be responsible for any Software upgrades (including charges) specified by the licensor or us.
