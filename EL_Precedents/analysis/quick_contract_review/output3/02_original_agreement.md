[END EXPLANATION]

      Confidential Information

      **1.** Confidentiality. Each Party shall maintain in confidence any and all information and materials disclosed or made available by or on behalf of the other Party (“Discloser”) or that the receiving Party (“Recipient”) obtains in connection with this Trial that is designated or that is reasonably expected to be confidential or proprietary under the circumstances (including the existence and terms of this Trial and the Parties’ trade secrets, business, technical and financial information not generally known to the public, such as business plans, strategies, metadata) (“Confidential Information”). NBCU Data and all metadata therein is NBCUniversal’s Confidential Information. Confidential Information does not include information that (a) Recipient rightfully possessed without a duty of confidentiality before obtaining it from Discloser; (b) is or becomes generally available to and known by the public through no fault of Recipient; (c) Recipient received on an unrestricted basis from a source unrelated to either Party and not under a duty of confidentiality with respect to the information; or (d) Recipient developed independently.

      **2.** Obligations. Recipient shall maintain in confidence Discloser’s Confidential Information and protect that Confidential Information from any unauthorized disclosure, access, use, destruction, alteration or loss, exercising at least the same degree of care as Recipient exercises for its own confidential and proprietary information, but not less than a reasonable degree of care. Subject to Sections 3, 4 and 7 of this Exhibit 2, Recipient shall not, nor permit or assist any person to, (a) use or copy Discloser’s Confidential Information, except as permitted in the Trial or as otherwise necessary to perform or receive the Vendor IP or to otherwise perform Recipient’s obligations under the Trial; or (b) disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to any person other than disclosures to Recipients’ then-current Affiliates and its and their authorized Personnel, legal counsel, accountants, banks and other financing sources and advisors as strictly necessary for such parties to advise or perform on behalf of Recipient or its applicable Affiliates (such persons, “Authorized Persons”). Recipient shall ensure that its Authorized Persons with access to Discloser’s Confidential Information are bound by written confidentiality obligations, or are otherwise under a duty of confidentiality, sufficient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information in a manner that is consistent with this Exhibit.

      **3.** Required Disclosure. Vendor shall, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, (a) notify NBCUniversal within three (3)  business days (provided that Vendor shall give such notice at least one business day prior to the applicable deadline for response) if any Applicable Law requires, or a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction requires or requests, that Vendor disclose NBCUniversal’s Confidential Information; and (b) use reasonable efforts to allow NBCUniversal an opportunity to seek injunctive relief from, or a protective order with respect to, the contemplated disclosure. If notification to NBCUniversal is prohibited by Applicable Law, or if it is not prohibited and that relief or order is not obtained, Vendor (i) may disclose only that portion of NBCUniversal’s Confidential Information that Vendor’s counsel advises is not subject to privilege and must be disclosed; and (ii) shall, at NBCUniversal’s expense, cooperate with NBCUniversal’s efforts to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law to ensure the disclosed Confidential Information is treated in a confidential manner after disclosure.

      **4.** Newsworthy Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Trial, any disclosure by NBCUniversal or Affiliates of Confidential Information in the ordinary course of their business of disseminating news and information is not a breach of the Trial; provided that the individuals involved in such dissemination received such Confidential Information from a source other than the Personnel of NBCUniversal (not including Vendor or its Personnel) involved in the Trial.

      **5.** Destruction/Return of Information. At Discloser’s request, or following any termination of the Trial, Recipient shall stop using Discloser’s Confidential Information, and, except as necessary to comply with Applicable Law, return to Discloser or destroy, at Discloser’s option, all of Discloser’s Confidential Information in Recipient’s or its Authorized Persons’ possession or control. Where NBCUniversal is the Discloser, such return or destruction shall be consistent with the NBCUniversal Security Standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NBCUniversal is not required to return or destroy Vendor’s Confidential Information backed up from a computer system in the ordinary course of NBCUniversal’s business, but that Confidential Information remains subject to all applicable obligations under the Trial.

      **6.** Confidentiality Term. Recipient’s obligations under this Exhibit regarding Discloser’s Confidential Information terminate five years after the end of the Term, except that Recipient’s obligations survive (a) for backed up Confidential Information, in accordance with Section 5 of this Exhibit 2; (b) for Data, in perpetuity; and (c) for Confidential Information that is a trade secret, for as long as such Confidential Information is a trade secret under Applicable Law.
