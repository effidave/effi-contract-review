## Comments on clause 3.1: (untitled)

### Full clause text

> License Grant.  [SUPPLIER] hereby grants to [CUSTOMER] and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable right and license to access and use (and have [CUSTOMER] agents and subcontractors exercise such rights on [CUSTOMER]’s behalf) the [SUPPLIER] IP during the Term.

### Reference text

> and its Affiliates

### Comments
> For [SUPPLIER]: Trial also extends to all group companies - is that ok?  Other parts of the licence look fine

---

## Comments on clause 3.2: "Specifications"

### Full clause text

> Specifications.  [SUPPLIER] will use reasonable efforts to cause the [SUPPLIER] IP to perform or otherwise comply in all material respects in accordance with any specifications related to the [SUPPLIER] IP provided to [CUSTOMER] or otherwise made publicly available.

### Comments
> For [SUPPLIER]: For a trial licence I normally remove warranties and indemnities and fall back to “as is”.  This largely depends on whether you are being paid / how much you are being paid.  From your email, I infer that you are prepared to accept some liability.

> Artificial Intelligence Use.  Except as expressly disclosed by [SUPPLIER] and authorized in writing by [CUSTOMER], the [SUPPLIER]’s services will neither be performed by, nor include the use of, an artificial intelligence tool or model.

## Comments on clause 4.0: "RESERVATION OF RIGHTS"

### Full clause text

> RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.  [CUSTOMER] acknowledges and agrees that, subject to [CUSTOMER]’s rights herein, [SUPPLIER] retains all right, title and interest, including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the [SUPPLIER] IP.

[SUPPLIER] may use such items and materials solely for the purpose of performing its obligations to [CUSTOMER] under this Trial and shall not, nor permit any person or entity to, copy, use or disclose NBCU Data to develop, train or improve any automated tool or device without [CUSTOMER]’s prior written approval.

### Comments
> For [SUPPLIER]:  They own any IP in any outputs from the system - I think that aligns with your model, but please let me know if they can only use the outputs during the term of the Trial licence.

## Edits to clause 5.0: "Fees & Payment"

### Original clause

> Fees & Payment.  In consideration for [SUPPLIER]’s performance of its obligations hereunder, [CUSTOMER] will pay to [SUPPLIER] the fees set forth in Exhibit 1 within seventy-five (75) days of [CUSTOMER]’s receipt of an undisputed, valid invoice separately stating the fees and any applicable sales tax or similar tax. [SUPPLIER] agrees to provide [CUSTOMER] with a properly completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and any other tax forms which [CUSTOMER] reasonably requests from [SUPPLIER].

### Changes
**Before:** ... Exhibit 1 within seventy-five (75) days of ...
**After:** ... Exhibit 1 within forty-five (45) days of ...

### Rationale
> For [CUSTOMER]: We suggest a compromise between 75 and our usual 45

## Edits to clause 8.0: "DATA SECURITY"

### Original clause

> DATA SECURITY. [SUPPLIER] shall comply with Exhibit 3 to this Trial.  [SUPPLIER] shall not process personal data or personal information (as such terms are defined under Applicable Law).

### Changes
**Before:** ... shall comply with Exhibit 3 to this Trial.  [SUPPLIER] shall ...
**After:** ... shall comply with clauses 6 (Data Retention and Descruction), 8 (Cyber Security Incidents) and 9 (Application and Software Requirements) of Exhibit 3 to this Trial.  Other than those specific clauses, Exhibit 3 shall not apply.  [SUPPLIER] shall ...

### Rationale
> For [CUSTOMER]: The requirements in Exhibit 3 go beyond what is necessary for this service and this Trial.  The risks inherent this service are more limited.

> For [SUPPLIER]: I have chosen these clauses from Exhibit 3 which probably map onto your existing processes.
