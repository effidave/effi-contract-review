   GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS


## 1. General

   1.1 The terms and conditions in this contract are the sole terms and conditions of the contract between One2Call Limited and the Customer. No variation or modification of these terms or conditions and no agreement made, or purported to be made, between One2Call Limited and the Customer inconsistent with these terms and conditions shall be valid, or of any effect, unless made in writing and signed by a Director of One2Call Limited. No representation regarding the Equipment shall be deemed to be by or on behalf of One2Call Limited, nor shall a representation bind

   One2Call Limited unless it is made in writing and signed by a

   Director of One2Call Limited.

   1.2 If you give us fourteen days prior notice and we agree, you or your appointed agents may carry out alterations to the Equipment or extension wiring. We reserve the right to inspect such work and, if found by us to be unsatisfactory, we shall require you and you will remedy the defect within ninety days of the inspection.


## 2. Our Duties

   2.1 You engage us and we agree to provide and carry out only at the Installation Address during the Term the following Maintenance services subject to the exclusions in clause 5 using reasonable skill and care;

   2.1.1 we will maintain or procure the maintenance of the Equipment at the Installation address shown overleaf in efficient working order during the Term;

   2.1.2 we will use all reasonable endeavours to arrive within 4 working hours for above 50% failure, or 9 working hours in all other cases (being 9.00am – 5.00pm Monday-Friday excluding public holidays),

   2.1.3 we will refund fifty pounds from the next year’s maintenance charge, each and every time we fail to arrive within the ISO 9002 guideline of 16 working hours, except when a delay occurs for reasons beyond our control. 2.1.4 We do not maintain any 2 wire devices.


## 3. Your Duties

   3.1 You shall at all times;

   3.1.1 orally notify us immediately of any fault in the Equipment and/or any repair necessary and then confirm your notification in writing and promptly provide us with any information which reasonably require to enable us to proceed uninterruptedly with the performance of this agreement, 3.1.2 afford our staff and our other authorised personnel full and safe access to the Installation Address and the Equipment to enable us to carry out the Maintenance Services; 3.1.3 provide us with, and be responsible for, the safety of such adequate free working space and facilities as may be necessary for the performance of this agreement;

   3.1.4 comply with all statutory requirements (including those relating to Health & Safety) which apply to the Maintenance Services and institute safe systems of work at the Installation Address;

   3.1.5 promptly inform us about any facts or opinions of which you become aware which are likely to affect our obligations under this agreement;

   3.1.6 keep the Equipment at the Installation Address; 3.1.7 except as provided in clause 1.2, not yourself maintain, service, repair, adjust, tamper, replace, alter or move the

   Equipment or the extension wiring.

   4.4 Payment shall be made by cheque, standing order or by direct debit, the instructions for which shall be signed by you at the same time that this agreement is signed. Direct debits shall not be cancelled without our written consent. 4.5 We may (without prejudice to our other rights and remedies);

   4.5.1 suspend performance of any or all of the Maintenance Services by giving written notice to you, if you are in default of your payment obligations under this agreement if so this would not prejudice any other remedies available to One2Call

   Limited; and

   4.5.2 charge you interest in respect of the late payment of any sum due under this agreement on a day to day basis (both before and after any judgement) at the rate of 4 per cent per annum above the base rate of National Westminster Bank plc from the due date for payment to the date of actual payment (both dates inclusive). The interest shall be paid by you on demand.

   4.6 Theft, loss of or destruction of or damage to the Equipment shall not affect your obligations under this clause. 4.7 After the initial term we may, if our costs increase, increase the annual maintenance charge by a maximum of 10%. Any increase above 10% will require both parties consent.

   4.8 We reserve the right to review the annual maintenance charge every 12 months, even within contract terms longer than 12 months, and increase the annual maintenance charge if the number of users, licences or software or other elements integral to the reliable operation of the phone system has changed from the originally agreed upon system specification.
