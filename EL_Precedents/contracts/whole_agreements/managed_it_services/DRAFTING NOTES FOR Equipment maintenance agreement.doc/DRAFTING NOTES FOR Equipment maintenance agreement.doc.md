# DRAFTING NOTES FOR Equipment maintenance agreement

by

Standard documents | Maintained | England, Wales

A B2B agreement in which the supplier agrees to provide a maintenance and support service for equipment. The agreement is drafted to be broadly neutral between the parties.

About this document
 
This document is an agreement for the maintenance of equipment in a business-to-business (B2B) context. The agreement is drafted to be broadly neutral between the parties.
  
Alternative agreements
 
Practical Law offers a range of services agreements. See .
  
Legal issues
 
We have set out below some of the key legal issues that typically arise when drafting an agreement for the maintenance of equipment in the B2B context.
 
For issues generally when considering drafting a services agreement, see .
 
 
Relationship with hire agreement (if applicable)
 
If the supplier of the services is also hiring the equipment under the terms of a separate agreement, the drafter will need to consider the relationship between the two agreements. For example:
 
Are the agreements co-terminous?
Are the parties’ respective obligations under the two agreements consistent?
Should service credits be on account of future hire fees?
For an equipment hire agreement in the B2B context, see standard documents:
 
.
.
 
Implied terms
 
The  (SGSA) applies to B2B contracts for the supply of services or for works and materials. Part II of the SGSA implies the following three terms into such contracts:
 
The supplier will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill ().
If the time for the services is not fixed by the contract, left to be fixed in a manner agreed in the contract or determined by the parties’ course of dealing, then there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the services within a reasonable time. What is “reasonable” is a question of fact ().
If the price of the services is not determined by the contract, left to be determined in a manner agreed in the contract or determined by the course of dealing between the parties, then there is an implied term that the customer will pay the supplier a reasonable charge. What is “reasonable” is a question of fact ().
In addition, Part I of the SGSA implies the following terms in relation to goods transferred under a contract for services (for example, spare parts or materials used as part of the services, such as in contracts for work and materials):
 
The seller has title, the buyer will enjoy quiet possession and the goods are free from encumbrances ().
The goods will correspond with their description ().
The goods will be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose ().
The goods will correspond with their sample ().
These implied terms do not apply in relation to the finished output of the services (such as any deliverables).
 
The  (UCTA) controls attempts to exclude these implied terms or limit liability for their breach as follows:
 
Exclusions or limitation in relation to the implied terms as to reasonable skill and care, correspondence with description, satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and correspondence with sample must be reasonable ( and ).
Exclusions or limitations in relation to implied terms as to title, quiet possession and freedom from encumbrances are void ().
 
Limiting liability
 
Like any other services agreement, the limitation of liability clause in an equipment maintenance agreement is likely to be a key area of negotiation. The clause should broadly reflect the value of the agreement and the parties needs to be comfortable with the financial exposure of the liability caps (see ).
 
If the supplier intends to use this standard document as its standard terms, a clause limiting liability for breach of contract or by which it claims to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from what was reasonably expected of it, or to render no performance at all, will only be valid if it is reasonable (, UCTA).
 
For a more detailed discussion of limitation of liability clauses, see practice notes:

Machine-generated data
 
This agreement envisages the supplier providing a regular “preventative” service and then corrective and emergency services as necessary. Increasingly, equipment support agreements are driven by machine-generated data, so that the supplier only inspects the equipment when prompted to do so by the data. This has the virtue of enabling a more focused service and reducing the number of call-outs (and therefore costs savings). However, if there is machine-generated data, the parties should address:
 
Ownership rights in the data.
Restrictions on the use the supplier can make of the data.
Confidentiality and security measures.
Rights to access the data.
 
Supply chain issues
 
Ensuring ethical practice throughout the supply chain is an issue of increasing importance to business customers. For a discussion of the key areas that could give rise to supply chain compliance requirements in the UK, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, and information security and cyber security issues, see .
 
 
Modern Slavery Act 2015
Commercial organisations carrying on business in the UK with a global annual turnover of £36 million or more must complete a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year, setting out the steps they have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its business or in its supply chains (, Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA)). Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.
 
For more information on the MSA and to access materials dealing with the MSA, see .
 
Bribery Act 2010
Of particular concern to businesses in a commercial context is the corporate offence of failure to prevent bribery by an associated person. A commercial organisation will be guilty of an offence if a person associated with it bribes another person intending to obtain or retain business for the commercial organisation, or to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for the commercial organisation (section 7, ). The commercial organisation has a defence if it can show that it had adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery by its associated persons.
 
For further information and an example of an anti-bribery clause, see . For background and all Practical Law materials on the Bribery Act, see .
 
Network security
The  (NISR) apply to “essential service providers” (electricity, water supply, gas and transport) and “relevant digital service providers” (search engines, online marketplaces and cloud computing service providers). NISR require these entities to ensure that they have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to manage the risks to the security of the network and information systems on which their services rely, and to notify the competent authority within a specified time frame if there is an incident which significantly impacts the continuity of its services.
 
A customer who is subject to NISR may want to flow down the security measures as required by NISR to the supplier. For suitable wording, see .
  
Drafting assumptions
 
Hire agreement. The supplier is not also hiring the equipment to the customer.
Data protection. The agreement does not involve the processing or sharing of personal data.
Machine-generated data. There is no machine-generated data.
Intellectual property rights. The agreement does not involve the transfer of any intellectual property rights.
TUPE. TUPE does not apply either on entry to or exit from the agreement. See .
UK companies. The customer and the supplier are companies incorporated in England and Wales. The customer is not a public body, so the UK rules relating to public procurement will not apply. See .
Business-to-business (B2B). The parties are dealing with each other in the course of their respective businesses (meaning that the UK rules protecting consumers will not apply).
Governing law. The agreement is subject to the law of England Wales

   Service Credits:  the sums attributable to a Service Failure as specified in  of Schedule 3.

   Service Failure:  a failure by the Supplier to deliver any part of the Services in accordance with the Service Levels.

   Service Failure
 
Service Failures are defined as applying to a failure by the supplier to perform a service in accordance with an applicable service level. The service level is the level of performance which must be achieved for the supplier to avoid paying any service credits. If the supplier’s performance in relation to any element of the services falls below an applicable service level, service credits become payable. Service credits usually accrue on a graduated basis up to a minimum threshold. If the supplier’s performance fails to meet that threshold, the customer may recover additional damages.

   Service Levels:  the service levels to which the Services are to be provided, as set out in  of Schedule 3.

   Service Levels
 
The service levels/service credits regime should focus on the key aspects of the service and reflect the customer’s needs. For example, a service interruption during peak hours may have more serious consequences than an interruption occurring outside peak hours. See also .

   Services Managers:  the managers appointed by the parties in accordance with  and .

   Spare Parts:  all spare components and subassemblies of the Equipment supplied for installation in the Equipment as part of the provision of the Services.

   Spare Parts
 
As with the definition of Equipment, consider whether this definition is wide enough. For example, should it cover parts that will be connected to the equipment but not actually installed in it? The definition deliberately says “supplied for installation” rather than “supplied and installed” so that the provisions of  (regarding payment for the spare parts) will apply in respect of parts supplied but not (yet, if ever) installed.

   Standard Maintenance Charges:  the charges payable in consideration of the provision of the Routine Maintenance and Corrective Maintenance, to be calculated in accordance with  of Schedule 4, as varied from time in accordance with .

   Term:  the Initial Term together with all Extended Terms.

   VAT:  value added tax [or any equivalent tax] chargeable in the UK [or elsewhere].]

   1.6  A reference to a holding company or a subsidiary means a holding company or a subsidiary (as the case may be) as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006 [and a company shall be treated, for the purposes only of the membership requirement contained in sections 1159(1)(b) and (c), as a member of another company even if its shares in that other company are registered in the name of:

   (a)  another person (or its nominee) by way of security or in connection with the taking of security; or

   (b)  its nominee].

   [For the purposes of determining whether a limited liability partnership is a subsidiary of a company or another limited liability partnership, section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006 shall be interpreted so that: (a) references in sections 1159(1)(a) and (c) to voting rights are to the members’ rights to vote on all or substantially all matters which are decided by a vote of the members of the limited liability partnership; and (b) the reference in section 1159(1)(b) to the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors is to the right to appoint or remove members holding a majority of the voting rights.]

   1.7  Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular include the plural and in the plural include the singular.

   1.8  Unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to one gender includes a reference to the other genders.

   1.9  [Unless expressly provided otherwise in this agreement, a OR A] reference to legislation or a legislative provision is a reference to it as [amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time OR it is in force as at the date of this agreement].

   1.10  [Unless expressly provided otherwise in this agreement, a OR A] reference to legislation or a legislative provision includes all subordinate legislation made [from time to time OR as at the date of this agreement] under that legislation or legislative provisions.

   1.11  A reference to writing or written excludes fax [and email OR but not email].

   In writing
 
On the meaning of “in writing” in commercial contracts, see .

   1.12  References to clauses and Schedules are to the clauses and Schedules of this agreement and references to paragraphs are to paragraphs of the relevant Schedule.

   1.13  Any words following the terms including, include, in particular, for example or any similar expression shall be interpreted as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words preceding those terms.

   2.  COMMENCEMENT AND DURATION

   Commencement and duration
 
This clause provides for an initial term which is automatically extended for multiple fixed terms. For more information on this clause and alternative drafting, see:
 
The drafting notes in .
 and .

   This agreement commences on the Commencement Date. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with ,  or this clause, this agreement continues [until [DATE] OR for [PERIOD]] (Initial Term) and automatically extends for [PERIOD] (Extended Term) at the end of the Initial Term and at the end of each Extended Term. Either party may give written notice to the other party, not later than [PERIOD] before the end of the Initial Term or the relevant Extended Term, to terminate this agreement at the end of the Initial Term or the relevant Extended Term, as the case may be.

   3.  [INSPECTION OF THE EQUIPMENT

   Inspection of the equipment (optional wording)
 
 provides a mechanism for the supplier to check that the equipment is in good working order at the start of the lifetime of the agreement. It envisages the payment of an initial inspection fee. If remedial work is required, the supplier provides a quotation for the work which, if rejected by the customer, will cause the agreement to terminate automatically.

   3.1  Inspection. On or shortly after the Commencement Date and upon payment by the Customer of the Inspection Fee, the Supplier shall carry out an inspection of the Equipment to determine whether it is in Good Working Order.

   3.2  Good Working Order Certificate. If the Supplier finds the Equipment to be in Good Working Order, it shall promptly issue a certificate to the Customer confirming this.

   3.3  Quotation to restore to Good Working Order. If the Supplier finds the Equipment not to be in Good Working Order, it shall issue a quotation to the Customer for the work and parts required to restore the Equipment to Good Working Order.

   3.4  Acceptance of quotation. If the Customer accepts the quotation referred to in , the Supplier shall carry out the work in accordance with the quotation, to the standard set out in . Upon completion of the work it shall submit its invoice for the work and upon payment of that invoice it shall issue a certificate to the Customer confirming that the Equipment is in Good Working Order.

   3.5  Automatic termination on rejection of quotation. If the Customer refuses the quotation, this agreement shall terminate automatically and without notice and without liability to either party, save that the Supplier shall be entitled to retain the Inspection Fee.]

   4.  SUPPLIER’S OBLIGATIONS

   Supplier’s obligations
 
This clause sets out the principal obligations of the supplier relating to the services (see also ).
 
 
Maintenance services
 
This clause sets out three main types of maintenance services to be provided by the supplier under this agreement. These are:
 
Routine maintenance. This is where the supplier attends the customer’s premises at a prearranged time to assess the equipment with the objective of pre-empting any potential problems, replacing consumables when necessary, and also repairing any equipment which has failed but the failure has gone unnoticed or which is not operating as it should. Consider how frequently the supplier will be required to carry out these pre-emptive visits.
Corrective maintenance. This is where the supplier attends the customer’s premises to repair the equipment in response to a request from the customer. The key distinction between corrective maintenance and emergency maintenance is that corrective maintenance is performed during normal business hours and is subject to the standard maintenance charges. The parties will need to consider and agree the level of commitment that the supplier will give in relation to any response time and fix time service levels.
Emergency maintenance. This is where the supplier attends the customer’s premises outside normal business hours and, as such, is charged at the additional services rates.
Not all agreements for the maintenance of equipment are the same, so the drafter is likely to need to amend the clauses specifying the supplier’s maintenance obligation in this  to some degree.
 
Consultancy services
 
The services also include a consultancy element (). Delete this clause (and associated definitions) if the supplier will not be providing a consultancy service in respect of the equipment.
 
Mandatory policies
 
In addition,  obliges the supplier to comply with applicable laws and the customer’s mandatory policies.
 
Change control
 
A simple maintenance agreement is unlikely to require the inclusion of a change control clause or other mechanism for varying the service description. If one is necessary, see .

   4.1  Supply of Services. During the Term, the Supplier shall supply the Services to the Customer.

   4.2  Supplier’s representative. A representative of the Supplier shall attend the Location [every [NUMBER] weeks OR at such frequency as is reasonably determined by the Supplier [but not more than once in every [PERIOD]] to perform the Routine Maintenance. The Supplier’s representative shall perform the Routine Maintenance during Business Hours at such times as may be agreed in advance between the Customer and the Supplier from time to time.

   4.3  Equipment malfunction. If the Supplier’s representative discovers that the Equipment is defective or is malfunctioning or has failed or is not otherwise in Good Working Order during the course of the Routine Maintenance the representative will use all reasonable endeavours to repair it during that visit at the Location. If that is not reasonably practicable (or it is not reasonably practicable to do so during Business Hours) the Supplier’s representative shall either arrange for a further visit to the Location within Business Hours to complete the repair, or [remove OR arrange for the removal of] the Equipment (or part of the Equipment, if applicable) for repair off-site.

   4.4  Corrective Maintenance. On the Customer informing the Supplier that the Equipment is defective or is malfunctioning or has failed or is not otherwise in Good Working Order, the Supplier shall [use all reasonable endeavours to] ensure that one of its representatives shall:

   (a)  attend the Location during Business Hours within the relevant Response Time to perform Corrective Maintenance; and

   (b)  complete the Corrective Maintenance within the relevant Fix Time.

   All reasonable endeavours (optional wording)
 
On the meaning of best or reasonable endeavours, see .

   4.5  Emergency Maintenance. On the Customer informing the Supplier that the Equipment is defective or is malfunctioning or has failed or is not otherwise in Good Working Order, and requires repair outside of Business Hours, the Supplier shall [use all reasonable endeavours to] ensure that one of its representatives shall:

   (a)  attend the Location within the relevant Response Time to perform Emergency Maintenance; and

   (b)  complete the Emergency Maintenance within the relevant Fix Time.

   4.6  Further site visits or repair off-site. Where it is not reasonably practicable for the Supplier’s representative to complete Corrective Maintenance or Emergency Maintenance at the Location on their first visit the Supplier’s representative shall either arrange for a further visit to the Location within Business Hours to complete the repair, or [remove OR arrange for the removal of] the Equipment (or part of the Equipment, if applicable) for repair off-site.

   4.7  Liability for delay if Customer refuses off-site repair. The Supplier shall not be liable for any delay in providing the relevant Maintenance Service if in the Supplier’s reasonable opinion it needs to remove the Equipment (or part of the Equipment, if applicable) for repair off-site and the Customer refuses this request.

   Effect of removal of equipment
 
Depending on the importance of the equipment to the customer’s business and the relationship of the parties, consider whether it is appropriate to include an obligation on the part of the supplier to loan replacement equipment to the customer during the period of the equipment’s removal off site.

   4.8  Provision of information. The Supplier shall:

   (a)  provide to the Customer from time in writing with such up to date and accurate information as to the application and use of the Equipment as may be available to the Supplier and as the Supplier may reasonably determine to be necessary or desirable to be provided; and

   (b)  without prejudice to , [use all reasonable endeavours to] respond promptly [and during the relevant Response Time], during Business Hours, by telephone[, video call] or in writing, as appropriate, to any request from the Customer for information concerning the application and use of the Equipment, or the repair of any defect in or malfunctioning of the Equipment.

   4.9  Health and safety compliance. The Supplier shall procure that its representatives shall, while on site at the Location, comply with the Customer’s reasonable health and safety and security policies provided that these have been made available to its representatives [in writing].

   4.10  Services manager. The Supplier shall appoint a manager for the Services. That person shall have authority to contractually bind the Supplier on all matters relating to the Services. The Supplier [shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the same person acts as the Supplier’s manager throughout the Term, but] may replace that person from time to time where reasonably necessary in the interests of the Supplier’s business.

   5.  SERVICE LEVELS

   Service levels
 
The detail of the service levels will be set out in . The provisions in this  set out how the service levels operate. The key principles are:
 
The supplier must provide the services so as to meet or exceed the service levels.
The supplier must report its actual performance (measured against the service levels) to the customer on a periodic (in this case monthly) basis.
The supplier will explain how it will meet any failure to perform to the required service levels.
The customer will be entitled to service credits if the supplier fails to meet any of the service levels.
This service level clause is short form. In particular, it does not include:
 
Provision for a detailed remediation plan.
Any step-in rights, where the customer takes over managerial control of the services pending the supplier demonstrating that it can resume control.
Graduated service credits.
A mechanism for dealing with the introduction of improvements.
The service levels regime in this standard document includes Critical Service Levels. If the supplier’s performance falls below this level an agreed number of times, the customer will be entitled to terminate ().
 
See  and  for the interaction with the service credit regime with the agreement’s limitation of liability clause.
 
For longer form wording, see .
 
This agreement does not set out a template for the service credit regime as these vary so much from agreement to agreement. For guidance on drafting a service credit schedule, see .

   5.1  Service Levels. The Supplier shall ensure that the Services meet or exceed the Service Levels at all times from the Commencement Date.

   5.2  Service Levels report. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a [monthly] report detailing its performance in respect of each of the Service Levels.

   5.3  Service Failure. If there is a Service Failure, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  notify the Customer immediately of the Service Failure;

   (b)  arrange all additional resources necessary to perform the Services in accordance with the Service Levels as soon as possible and at no additional charge to the Customer; and

   (c)  credit the Customer with the Service Credits, which shall take effect as an adjustment to the Standard Maintenance Charges.

   Remediation of service failure
 
This is a very short form clause. For a longer form alternative, see , which includes provision for a remediation plan.

   5.4  Notification of prospective failure to achieve Service Levels. The Supplier shall notify the Customer promptly of any prospective failure to meet the Service Levels and the parties’ respective Services Managers shall meet as soon as practicable to discuss how to remedy this.

   6.  SPARE PARTS AND CONSUMABLES

   6.1  Supply of Spare Parts and Consumables. The Supplier shall supply and fit such Spare Parts and Consumables as required to maintain the Equipment in Good Working Order or to restore the Equipment to Good Working Order. The cost of such Spare Parts and Consumables shall be borne in accordance with .

   6.2  Cost of Spare Parts and Consumables. The Customer shall reimburse the Supplier in accordance with  for the Spare Parts and Consumables at actual cost provided that:

   (a)  the Customer shall not reimburse the cost of any Spare Parts or Consumables unless they are approved in advance [in writing] by the Customer; and

   (b)  the Supplier shall not be entitled to reimbursement unless it promptly provides the Customer with evidence reasonably requested to verify the accuracy of the costs it has incurred for the Spare Parts and Consumables (including receipts and invoices).

   Cost of spare parts and consumables
 
There are several alternative approaches beyond that set out in , which is that the customer must approve the cost of spare parts and consumables in advance. This approach is better suited to equipment which will not regularly require replacement spare parts and consumables: Alternatives include:
 
The supplier can incur expenses up to an agreed amount per item and an agreed aggregate amount over a period, but amounts above that threshold require the customer’s consent. Pre-agreed costs could be set out in a schedule to the agreement.
The supplier bears all the costs. If this approach is adopted, the supplier must ensure its pricing structure captures the cost of spare parts and consumables.
The supplier may insist on a mark-up on the actual cost price, giving it a profit element.
Where the supplier finds a defect or malfunctioning in the equipment, it issues a quotation for the cost of the remedial work, including spare parts.
The customer may require that:
 
The expenses must be incurred in accordance with the customer’s expenses policy, as updated from time to time.
The supplier uses its best (or all reasonable) endeavours to minimise the costs.
For more suggested drafting, see .

   6.3  Quality of Spare Parts and Consumables and transfer of title in Spare Parts and Consumables. All Spare Parts shall be either new, or reconditioned or reassembled Spare Parts which are equivalent to new Spare Parts in performance. All Consumables shall be new. The Supplier will transfer to the Customer, with full title guarantee and free from all third party rights, all the Spare Parts and Consumables that it provides to the Customer, and the Spare Parts [and Consumables] shall become part of the Equipment upon their installation in the Equipment.

   7.  CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS

   7.1  Proper use of Equipment. The Customer shall at all times during the Term:

   (a)  use the Equipment only in accordance with the [Operating Manual OR instructions and recommendations of the manufacturer of the Equipment] or as may be advised [in writing] from time to time by the Supplier;

   (b)  [permit only trained and competent personnel to use the Equipment;]

   (c)  notify the Supplier promptly and in the manner set out in  if the Equipment is discovered to be defective or malfunctioning or has failed or is otherwise not in Good Working Order;

   (d)  keep the Equipment in the environmental conditions recommended [in the Operating Manual OR by the manufacturer of the Equipment] or as may be advised [in writing] from time to time by the Supplier;

   (e)  not allow any other person than the Supplier’s representatives to adjust, maintain, repair, replace or remove the Equipment or any part of it, unless otherwise agreed [in writing] by the Supplier; and

   (f)  not move the Equipment from the Location without the prior [written] consent of the Supplier (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

   7.2  Access to Equipment. The Customer shall ensure that the Supplier’s representatives have:

   (a)  full and free access to the Location and to the Equipment [and to a power supply and other facilities necessary to operate the Equipment]; [and]

   (b)  full and free access to any records of its use kept by the Customer[; and OR ,]

   (c)  [adequate and safe working space and facilities,]

   to enable the Supplier to perform its obligations under this agreement.

   7.3  Provision of information to Supplier. The Customer shall provide the Supplier with such information concerning the Equipment, its application, use, location and environment as the Supplier may reasonably request to enable it to perform its obligations under this agreement.

   7.4  Malfunction reports. The Customer shall report that the Equipment is defective or malfunctioning or has failed or is otherwise not in Good Working Order either in writing or by telephone [or video call], or in such other manner as the Supplier may reasonably require from time to time.

   7.5  Safety. The Customer shall take all such steps as may be necessary to ensure the safety of any of the Supplier’s representatives when attending the Location.

   7.6  Customer Services manager. The Customer shall appoint a manager for the Services. That person shall have authority to contractually bind the Customer on all matters relating to the Services. The Customer [shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the same person acts as the Customer’s manager throughout the Term, but] may replace that person from time to time where reasonably necessary in the interests of the Customer’s business.

   7.7  Delay due to Customer. If the Supplier’s performance of its obligations under this agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of the Customer, its agents, subcontractors, consultants or employees, then, without prejudice to any other right or remedy it may have, the Supplier shall be allowed an extension of time to perform its obligations equal to the delay caused by the Customer.

   Failure or delay caused by customer
 
This clause provides for an automatic extension of time for performance where the supplier’s inability or delay to provide the services is caused by the customer. It is without prejudice to any other rights and remedies the supplier may have, including at common law. At common law, if the customer fails to perform or delays in performing its obligations:
 
The supplier will not be liable for its breaches to the extent that these are caused by the customer.
The supplier may, subject to its duty to mitigate, claim damages for any losses or additional costs incurred.
The supplier may have a right to terminate for breach.
Some agreements set out the above remedies specifically. However, this is generally a pro-customer approach, as it is often used to restrict the remedies that the supplier would otherwise have at common law, for example by removing the right to terminate and restricting the sums which may be claimed or by making the supplier’s right to claim subject to the supplier giving the customer notice of the delay and taking specified steps to mitigate its effects.

   8.  EXCLUDED MAINTENANCE

   8.1  No obligation to perform Excluded Maintenance. The Supplier is not obliged to perform any Excluded Maintenance.

   8.2  Additional Services Charges. Where the Supplier is performing or has performed the Maintenance Services in circumstances where it is established that the Equipment was not in Good Working Order due to any of the Excluded Causes, the Supplier may charge, and the Customer shall pay, the Additional Services Charges in respect of that work.

   8.3  Investigation charges. If on investigation the Supplier reasonably determines that any defect in or malfunctioning of the Equipment is the result of an Excluded Cause, the Customer shall pay Additional Services Charges in respect of the time incurred by the Supplier in making the investigation and determining the cause of the defect in or malfunctioning of the Equipment.

   9.  CHARGES AND PAYMENT

   Charges and payment
 
There are several options for pricing arrangements including:
 
Time (and materials).
Fixed price.
Hybrid arrangements of the two.
This clause assumes that  will specify the charges.
 
 provides some detail on how the daily rates work, which should be amended to reflect the actual position (and alternatively could be set out in ).
 
See  concerning payment for spare parts and consumables.

   9.1  Standard Maintenance Charges. In consideration of the performance of the Routine Maintenance and the Corrective Maintenance the Customer shall pay to the Supplier the Standard Maintenance Charges.

   9.2  Additional Services Charges. In consideration of the performance of any Additional Services the Customer shall pay to the Supplier the Additional Services Charges.

   9.3  Consultancy Services Charges. In consideration of the performance of any Consultancy Services the Customer say pay to the Supplier the Consultancy Services Charges.

   9.4  [Time and materials. Where the Charges are calculated on a time and materials basis:

   (a)  the Supplier’s daily fee rates for each individual person as set out in  shall be calculated on the basis of an eight-hour day, worked during Business Hours;

   (b)  the Supplier shall ensure that every individual whom it engages on the Services completes time sheets to record time spent on the Services, and the Supplier shall indicate the time spent per individual in its invoices.]

   Time and materials (optional wording)
 
Delete this clause if none of the charges will be calculated on a time and materials basis.

   9.5  Inclusive charges. The Charges shall be inclusive of all expenses and the cost to the Supplier of any materials or services procured by the Supplier from third parties for the provision of the Services (other than those recoverable in accordance with ).

   Costs and expenses
 
 provides that the charges are inclusive of expenses and third-party charges. Amend if this is not the agreed commercial position and ensure that this clause is consistent with  concerning spare parts and consumables.
 
The supplier should ensure that its pricing structure incorporates costs associated with the removal of equipment from the premises (and storage costs, if applicable) .

   9.6  Charges increases. The Supplier may increase the Charges on an annual basis with effect from each anniversary of the Commencement Date in line with the percentage increase in the [Consumer Prices Index (all items)] in the preceding 12-month period, and the first such increase shall take effect on the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and shall be based on the latest available figure for the percentage increase in the [Consumer Prices Index (all items)].

   Increase in charges
 
This clause allows the supplier to increase the charges annually by reference to a recognised index, in this case the Consumer Prices Index (all items). This provision guarantees a minimum increase for the supplier, who is always free to negotiate a higher one. At the very least the customer is likely to insist on minimum notice of the increase in charges. The customer may also seek to agree a cap limiting the amount by which the supplier may increase its prices, each year. Finally, the customer may also wish to have the right to terminate if it finds the increase unacceptable, although this may be commercially impractical.
 
For more detail on price variation clauses, see  and .

   9.7  Monthly invoices. The Supplier shall invoice the Customer at the end of each month for Services performed during that month and the cost of any Spare Parts and Consumables incurred during that month.

   9.8  Payment timing. The Customer shall pay each invoice submitted to it by the Supplier within [30] days of receipt to a bank account nominated in writing by the Supplier from time to time.

   9.9  Failure to pay. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy that it may have, if the Customer fails to make a payment due to the Supplier under this agreement by the due date, then:

   (a)  the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue sum from the due date until payment of the overdue sum, whether before or after judgment. Interest under this  will accrue each day at 4% a year above the Bank of England’s base rate from time to time, but at 4% a year for any period when that base rate is below 0%; and

   (b)  the Supplier may suspend all or part of the Services until payment has been made in full.

   Interest and suspension
 
This clause allows the supplier to charge interest and suspend performance if invoices are not paid on time. Consider whether it would be preferable for the supplier to rely on the statutory right to interest on late payments.
 
The customer may require the supplier to give notice of its intention to charge interest and suspend performance and give the customer a grace period in which to pay the outstanding amount.
 
For a discussion on interest clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   9.10  Tax and set-off. All sums payable to the Supplier under this agreement:

   (a)  are exclusive of VAT, and the Customer shall in addition pay an amount equal to any VAT chargeable on those sums on delivery of a VAT invoice; and

   (b)  shall be paid in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law).

   Set-off
 
 is supplier-friendly. As the payment obligation is one way, a supplier will wish to exclude a right of set-off, while a customer may want to add to the common law and equitable right of set-off with a contractual right of set-off.
 
For a discussion on set-off clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   10.  WARRANTIES

   The Supplier warrants on an ongoing basis that:

   10.1  it shall discharge its obligations under this agreement using personnel of the required skill, experience and qualifications and with all due skill, care and diligence including in accordance with Good Industry Practice[. OR ; and

   10.2  all Spare Parts, Consumables and equipment supplied or used in the course of the provision of the Services shall operate materially in accordance with their technical specifications.]

   Quality of services and spare parts and consumables
 
The customer may also consider seeking a time-limited warranty as to the effectiveness of repairs to the equipment undertaken by the supplier.

   11.  [COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND POLICIES

   Compliance with laws and policies (optional wording)
 
For information on this clause, see the integrated drafting notes to .
 
The supplier may wish to reserve the right to increase its charges where there is a change in law which impacts on the cost to the supplier of providing the services. For a more sophisticated clause, which distinguishes between types of changes in law and provides that the customer need only bear the costs of unanticipated changes in legislation, see .
 
A supplier may wish to reserve the right to terminate if it is unwilling or unable to comply with an update to one of the mandatory policies notified to it by the customer.

   In performing its obligations under this agreement, the Supplier shall comply with:

   11.1  the Applicable Laws; and

   11.2  the Mandatory Policies, provided that the Customer shall give the Supplier not less than [NUMBER] months’ notice of any change to such policies.]

   12.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   Limitation of liability
 
Limitation of liability is always a key issue in a contract for services. Always tailor this clause to the particular transaction. It is likely to be the subject of considerable negotiation between the parties.
 
We strongly recommend reading the following practice notes relating to limiting liability in B2B contracts:
 
.
.
.
 
Approach in this clause
 
This clause sets out a fairly basic structure for a limitation of liability clause which is commonly found in negotiated agreements. It is divided into the following sections:
 
Unlimited liabilities. Neither party limits those liabilities which cannot be limited as a matter of law.
Capped liabilities. Each party limits all other liabilities which might arise to a capped amount. The cap applies to each contract year and is the higher of a fixed sum or a percentage of that year’s charges.
Treatment of certain categories of loss. The clause provides wording to exclude certain categories of loss, such as indirect and consequential loss. There is also an option to carve out certain sub-categories or specific losses from these exclusions. So, for example, the agreement could specify that wasted expenditure in general is excluded but that certain specific costs are not. Or that loss of business in general is excluded but loss of a particular client or contract is not.
 
Why have a limitation clause if acting for the customer?
 
Sometimes pro-customer agreements do not contain any limitation or exclusion of liability for breach of contract for either party. Obviously, this approach favours a customer, as it is the supplier, as the performing party, who takes on the greater risk under the contract. This also means the customer’s own liability under the contract is unlimited, but the customer may be prepared to accept such a risk if its principal obligation is only to pay the charges.
 
However, in practice in negotiated agreements, it would be extremely unusual for a supplier to accept such an approach, because as the performing party it will always look to limit its liability. The supplier could argue that to remain in business and continue serving the customer it needs to cap its liability in a sensible way.
 
A customer may prefer to include a limitation clause which is acceptable to it as a starting point for negotiations.
 
For detailed information on this clause, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   12.1  Scope of this clause. The following definitions apply in this :

   (a)  liability: every kind of liability arising under or in connection with this agreement including liability in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise.

   (b)  default: any act or omission resulting in one party incurring liability to the other.

   12.2  Unlimited liabilities.Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes:

   (a)  [liability for deliberate default;]

   (b)  liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence to the extent preserved by section 2(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977;

   (c)  liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;

   (d)  liability for breach of the terms implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982;

   (e)  any liability that cannot legally be limited; or

   (f)  the Customer’s payment obligations under this agreement.

   12.3  Supplier’s liability cap. Subject to , the Supplier’s total liability:

   (a)  [in respect of Service Credits, shall be limited, in each Contract Year, to [PERCENTAGE]% of the charges paid [or payable] to the Supplier under this agreement in that Contract Year; and]

   (b)  in respect of all other defaults occurring within a Contract Year shall not exceed [£[AMOUNT]] OR [[PERCENTAGE]% OR the greater of £[MINIMUM AMOUNT] and [PERCENTAGE]%] of the charges paid [or payable] to the Supplier under this agreement in that Contract Year].

   12.4  Service Credits. The Service Credits shall be the exclusive financial remedy for the Customer for each Service Failure for which a Service Credit has been set, unless:

   (a)  any failure to meet the Service Levels (either on an individual basis or in aggregate) constitutes a failure beyond that for which the Service Credits have been set; or

   (b)  the Customer is otherwise entitled to terminate this agreement for the Supplier’s breach; or

   (c)  the failure to perform the Services in accordance with the Service Levels has arisen due to theft, gross negligence, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or wilful default.

   Service credits as sole remedy
 
Consider carefully whether service credits should be the customer’s sole financial remedy for the applicable default. Any pre-determined deductions must not give rise to a penalty payment (see ). However, in practice, service credits are often set at a level which is much lower than the actual losses. As such, they operate principally as a tool to encourage the supplier to perform to the required level rather than to compensate the customer fully for all the losses which arise.
 
One solution is to provide that the customer reserves its right to claim damages if the supplier’s performance drops below a given threshold provided always that any service credits which have already been paid to the customer should be deducted from the value of the total claim.
 
In this agreement, the customer has the right to terminate where the supplier commits a set number of Critical Service Failures ().

   12.5  Service credits and cap on liability of Supplier. [No OR The] amounts awarded or agreed to be paid under  shall count towards the cap on the Supplier’s liability under .

   12.6  Customer’s liability cap. Subject to , the Customer’s total liability shall not exceed [£[AMOUNT]] OR [[PERCENTAGE]% OR the greater of £[MINIMUM AMOUNT] and [PERCENTAGE]%] of the charges paid [or payable] to the Supplier under this agreement].

   12.7  Losses that are excluded. Subject to  and  neither party shall have any liability for:

   (a)  loss of profits (including loss of anticipated savings);

   (b)  loss of sales or business;

   (c)  loss of agreements or contracts;

   (d)  loss of use or corruption of software, data or information;

   (e)  loss of or damage to goodwill; or

   (f)  indirect or consequential loss.

   12.8  Losses that are not excluded.  does not exclude any liability the Supplier may have for:

   (a)  wasted expenditure;

   (b)  [reasonable] costs and expenses [necessarily] incurred by the Customer in remedying the Supplier’s default. These include consultancy costs, additional costs of management time and other personnel costs, and costs of equipment and materials;

   (c)  [reasonable] costs incurred by the Customer in procuring and implementing replacements for, or alternatives to, goods or services not provided in accordance with this agreement;

   (d)  [losses incurred by the Customer arising out of or in connection with any third party claim against the Customer which has been caused by the Supplier’s default. For these purposes, third party claims include [but are not limited to] demands, fines, penalties, actions, regulatory investigations or proceedings OR fines, penalties or similar amounts imposed on the Customer by any regulator as a result of, and increased compliance costs caused by, the Supplier’s default];

   (e)  the loss of anticipated savings in respect of [SOURCE OF SAVINGS]; or

   (f)  [OTHER SPECIFIC LOSSES].

   12.9  Exclusion of statutory implied terms. The Supplier has given commitments as to the performance of the Services in  and a warranty in respect of performance of the Services and the performance of Spare Parts, Consumables and equipment supplied or used in the course of the provision of the Services in . In view of these commitments, all conditions, warranties, representations or other terms that might otherwise be implied into this agreement are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from this agreement, including the conditions and terms implied by sections 3 to 5 and 13 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.

   Exclusion of statutory implied terms (optional wording)
 
The supplier’s argument for excluding the statutory implied terms is that  and  set out the full quality requirements to which it is committing. These bespoke commitments may well influence whether the exclusion is reasonable and for this reason they are referred to in the clause.
 
On the implied terms, see .

   12.10  No liability for claims not notified within [NUMBER] months. Unless a party notifies the other party that it intends to make a claim within the notice period, the other party shall have no liability for that claim. The notice period shall start on the day on which the party wishing to make a claim became[, or ought reasonably to have become,] aware of its having grounds to make a claim and shall expire [NUMBER] months from that date. The notice must be in writing and must identify the grounds for the claim in reasonable detail.

   13.  NON-SOLICITATION

   Non-solicitation
 
This clause is a form of restraint of trade clause and restricts each party from attempting to “poach” the other’s employees or contractors for a set period. The clause is limited to solicitation. Thus:
 
It does not prevent a party from hiring the other’s employees where the employee makes an unsolicited approach.
It does not apply to an employee/contractor of one party applying for a nationally advertised position with the other party.
A non-solicitation clause is only enforceable if the restriction on solicitation goes no further than is reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interest of the party seeking to enforce it. It will not usually be reasonable to prevent a business from approaching employees whose departure is unlikely to be capable of causing damage to the party wanting to enforce the restriction, for example:
 
Employees in junior positions.
Employees with whom it has had no involvement during the lifetime of the contract or who are not involved in the provision of the services.
The approach in this clause is therefore to restrict the scope of the restrictive covenant to employees above a certain level of seniority involved in the services or the management of the agreement. The drafting also gives the option of restricting solicitation to six or 12 months post-termination or expiry. The longer term may be more appropriate in respect of more senior employees although the reasonableness of the term will depend on the nature of the agreement and factual matrix.
 
The clause could be further refined by defining more precisely the categories of employees.
 
This restriction will capture persons employed or engaged by the covenantee during the lifetime of the agreement but not persons employed or engaged after its termination (or expiry). As persons appointed post-termination (or expiry) will not have been involved in the subject matter of the agreement it would usually be unreasonable to make such persons subject to the restriction.

   13.1  No solicitation of Restricted Persons. To protect their respective legitimate business interests each party covenants with the other for itself and as agent for each member of its Group that it shall not (and shall procure that no member of its Group shall) (except with the prior written consent of the other party):

   (a)  attempt to solicit or entice away; or

   (b)  solicit or entice away,

   from the employment or service of the other party or any member of its Group the services of any Restricted Person other than by means of a national advertising campaign open to all-comers and not specifically targeted at the staff of the other party or any member of its Group.

   13.2  Term of restrictive covenant. The parties shall be bound by the covenant set out in  during the Term, and for a period of [6 OR 12] months after termination or expiry of this agreement.

   13.3  Restricted Persons. For the purposes of this , a Restricted Person shall mean any firm, company or person employed or engaged by a party or any member of its Group during the Term [at the level of [POSITION] or above], who has been engaged in the provision of the Services or the management of this agreement.

   13.4  Consent. Any consent given in accordance with  shall be subject to payment to the consenting party of a sum equivalent to [20%] of the then current annual remuneration of the Restricted Person or, if higher, [20%] of the annual remuneration to be paid to the Restricted Person.

   14.  TERMINATION

   Termination
 
For a discussion on termination clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .
 
The clause provides three sets of termination rights:
 
 is a mutual termination clause which enables either party to terminate upon the occurrence of specific events such as material breach, non-payment and insolvency-related events (but see ).
 gives the supplier an additional termination right if it determines that the equipment can no longer be maintained in good working order or it is damaged beyond economic repair (unless caused by the supplier’s own default).
 gives the customer an additional termination right if the supplier either commits an agreed number of critical service failures or it fails to comply with applicable law or the customer’s mandatory policies.
 
Termination for insolvency
 
From 26 June 2020, it has become difficult or impossible for a supplier to terminate many contracts for goods or (non-financial) services on the grounds that the customer has entered a corporate insolvency procedure (, Insolvency Act 1986). See .
 
To overcome this,  provides that either party can terminate if in its reasonable opinion the other’s financial position has deteriorated to the point where its ability to perform its obligations under the agreement is in jeopardy. In practice, however, this trigger may be difficult to invoke. The supplier would need to be confident it could justify the necessary opinion and may lack access to full information or the resources to monitor the customer’s financial position. If the supplier terminates without the legal and factual grounds to do so it risks liability for wrongful termination, as discussed in .
 
Termination for convenience
 
This agreement does not include a right to terminate for convenience. For suggested wording and drafting considerations if a termination for convenience is needed, see .

   14.1  Termination by either party. Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either party may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving [written] notice to the other party if:

   (a)  the other party fails to pay any amount due under this agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than [NUMBER] days after being notified in writing to make such payment;

   (b)  the other party commits a material breach of any other term of this agreement and (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of [NUMBER] days after being notified [in writing] to do so;

   (c)  the other party repeatedly breaches any of the terms of this agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement;

   (d)  the other party suspends, or threatens to suspend, payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or admits inability to pay its debts or is deemed unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as if the words “it is proved to the satisfaction of the court” did not appear in sections 123(1)(e) or 123(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986;

   (e)  the other party commences negotiations with all or any class of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its debts, or makes a proposal for or enters into any compromise or arrangement with any of its creditors [other than for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (f)  the other party applies to court for, or obtains, a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986;

   (g)  a petition is filed, a notice is given, a resolution is passed, or an order is made, for or in connection with the winding up of the other party [other than for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (h)  an application is made to court, or an order is made, for the appointment of an administrator, or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given or an administrator is appointed, over the other party;

   (i)  the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of that other party has become entitled to appoint or has appointed an administrative receiver;

   (j)  a person becomes entitled to appoint a receiver over all or any of the assets of the other party or a receiver is appointed over all or any of the assets of the other party;

   (k)  a creditor or encumbrancer of the other party attaches or takes possession of, or a distress, execution, sequestration or other such process is levied or enforced on or sued against, the whole or any part of the other party’s assets and such attachment or process is not discharged within [14] days;

   (l)  any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the other party in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events mentioned in  to  (inclusive);

   (m)  the other party suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business;

   (n)  the other party’s financial position deteriorates so far as to reasonably justify the opinion that its ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement is in jeopardy; or

   (o)  there is a change of control of the other party.

   14.2  Material breach. For the purposes of , material breach means:

   (a)  a breach of any of the obligations set out in clauses [NUMBERS]; or

   (b)  a breach that has a serious effect on the benefit the terminating party would otherwise derive from this agreement [over any [NUMBER]-month period during the Term].

   14.3  Termination by Supplier. Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, the Supplier may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the Customer if the Supplier reasonably determines that the Equipment can no longer be maintained in Good Working Order by the provision of Spare Parts or Consumables or the Equipment is damaged beyond economic repair otherwise than through the Supplier’s fault.

   14.4  Termination by Customer. Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, the Customer may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the Supplier if:

   (a)  [the Supplier has committed [NUMBER] Critical Service Failure(s) [in any [PERIOD]]; or]

   (b)  [the Supplier commits a breach of .]

   Customer’s right to terminate for supplier’s breach
 
Delete  if this agreement does not contain critical service levels. Depending on the nature of the critical service failures, the supplier may wish to include the optional wording in longer-term agreements so that historic failures are not taken into account years later.
 
The supplier may seek to amend  by including a materiality qualification. Alternatively, the drafting could be amended to state that breach of  is a material breach within , giving the supplier the opportunity to remedy the breach (if it is capable of remedy) ().

   15.  CONSEQUENCES OF TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL

   Consequences of termination and survival
 
See the integrated drafting notes to  for a discussion of consequences of termination clauses including:
 
Why a survival clause is necessary.
Obligations on termination: payment obligations and return of materials.
Exit management: handover of service provision to the customer or a new supplier.
 
Exit services
 
If the services require a transition back to the customer or a new supplier when the agreement terminates or expires, the parties may wish to consider including provisions for an exit plan.
 
For a discussion of exit management generally, see .
 
For a very short form exit assistance clause, see .
 
Return of materials
 
This standard document does not envisage the supplier having to hand over any materials to the customer on termination. If the customer envisages the need to include such an obligation, most obviously to ensure it has copies of maintenance records, see .

   15.1  Unpaid invoices and survival. On termination [or expiry] of this agreement:

   (a)  the Customer shall immediately pay to the Supplier all the Supplier’s outstanding unpaid invoices and interest and, in respect of the Services supplied but for which no invoice has been submitted, the Supplier may submit an invoice, which shall be payable immediately on receipt; and

   Payment of outstanding invoices
 
If payments are made in advance, consider including a requirement for the return of payments in advance for a service that has not been, and will not now be, provided.

   (b)  any provision of this agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination [or expiry] of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

   15.2  Accrued rights. Termination [or expiry] of this agreement shall not affect any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties that have accrued up to the date of termination [or expiry], including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the agreement which existed at or before the date of termination [or expiry].

   16.  CONFIDENTIALITY

   Confidentiality
 
If confidentiality is a major issue, the most effective method to prevent disclosure of the information is to attach a schedule of specified individuals who are permitted to receive the information and then to inform each individual that the information handled is to be treated as confidential. If necessary, the individuals concerned could each be asked to sign a specific confidentiality undertaking with the supplier of this information.
