Hi Joe,

Great to speak with you earlier, just to recap points of discussion,
(please feel free to add more context / correct any details)

I have reached out to colleagues in the Cyber and PI teams and will
sending over proposal forms ASAP.

-   Wise.AI is there result of stripping IP from a previous company
    which was been sold and repacking into its own entity.

    -   Limits of cover as per the agreement

You have confirmed

-   Turnover intially will be approx £300K ( value of the first
    contract, but expected to grow with additional contracts) -- First
    contract is £180k, but expect revenue to be in the region of
    £500k+in the next 12 months.

-   Headcount -- 4 however these are employed by your other company, we
    will still look to arrange the Employers liability cover, as defined
    in the policy wordings, there will still be an exposure to the
    business + a requirement of the contract -- If Directors count as
    employees, so we have 3 in Vizopay Ltd (Wiseflow).

-   You are looking to get cover in place ASAP, to allow the contracts
    with the bank to be signed.

-   At some point you may look to bring this entity into the group with
    your other company, ( please can you confirm this entity also) -
    Avallo Ltd - 15500206

-   We will be able to facilitiate and advise in a more stategic manner.

-   Your other company is currently insured directly with Hiscox

We will look to arrange the following covers

    business interupriuon, or any computer equipment? We can package all
    of this together at minimual cost)

Are you able to confirm the following,

-   Full name of the Entity + companies house number (Vizopay Ltd --

-   What is the required jurisdication for the cover, is this to be UK
    or USA -- this is a key question and may affect the ability to
    secure the unlimited limits you have requested. Legally only the UK,
    however the client will be using it across EU market.

-   Have you or any of your partners/directors (in connection with any
    business you have been involved in):

        refused? No.

Please note

If you are a business and your insurance policy is governed by English
law, you must, at all times, act with utmost good faith towards your
insurer. Before your policy is placed, at renewal, and when varying or
extending the policy, you have a duty under the Insurance Act 2015 to
make a "fair presentation" of the risk and you must disclose to your
insurer all information, facts, and circumstances which are, or ought to
be, known to you and which are material to the risk. In addition, if
your policy contains a particular clause stating that any change in
circumstances must be advised to your insurer, you will also have to
disclose certain information during the policy period.

When providing information or completing a proposal form or otherwise
confirming any information to your insurer, you should take care to
ensure that the details provided are complete and accurate.

As soon as I have the correct proposal forms, I will forward them over
to you, if you could aim to return them at your earliest convienience, I
will then reach out to the markets to obtain quote urgently,

We might need to jump on another call, if we get any specific queires,
but can cross that bridge when we come it it.
