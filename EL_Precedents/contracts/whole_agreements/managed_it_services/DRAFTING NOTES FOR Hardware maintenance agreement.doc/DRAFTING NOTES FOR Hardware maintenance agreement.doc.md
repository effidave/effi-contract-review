# DRAFTING NOTES FOR Hardware maintenance agreement

by  and Stephen Reeves, Pinsent Masons

Standard documents | Maintained | United Kingdom

An agreement drafted from the supplier’s point of view, in which the supplier agrees to provide support and maintenance for certain hardware supplied by the supplier.

About this document
 
An agreement drafted from the Supplier’s point of view, in which the Supplier agrees to provide support and maintenance for certain hardware supplied by the Supplier. Although primarily a hardware maintenance agreement, the agreement also covers updates to software where these are provided with the hardware, see .
 
 
Assumptions
 
It is assumed for the purpose of this standard document that:
 
The supplier and the customer are UK limited companies, and the customer is a business user.
The agreement has been drafted in consideration of, and is subject to, English law.
Any goods or services to be provided under the agreement, are to be provided in the UK exclusively. (If goods or services are to be provided in jurisdictions outside the UK, the laws of those jurisdictions will need to be considered, separately, by each party).
No specific cybersecurity standards apply to the parties, or to any goods or services that are to be provided under this agreement, under English law (or the law of any other jurisdiction). For more information, see .
 
Cybersecurity
 
Cybersecurity obligations are becoming more prominent in IT agreements, including as statutory controls and obligations in relation to network and information system, and data, security are increasing, see:
 
.
:
Specific UK cybersecurity legal standards may apply in particular circumstances, including in relation to:
 
Certain regulated activities and sectors, see .
Certain operators of essential services and relevant digital service providers, see .
Certain consumer connectable products, see .
Personal data, see .
Cyber laws in other jurisdictions may also apply extraterritorially to organisations in the UK, depending on where goods and services are being provided. By way of example, see .
 
This agreement is drafted on the assumption that no specific cybersecurity laws or legal standards apply to the parties, or to the goods or services which are the subject matter of this agreement, in the UK or elsewhere, see . If they do, then this may necessitate the inclusion of certain provisions into the agreement, or the party subject to the requirements may wish to flow them down to their counterparty.
 
To determine whether a legal requirement applies, a cybersecurity risk assessment may be necessary or helpful. For more information on conducting cybersecurity risk assessments, see . For more information about managing cyber risk in an organisation’s supply chain, see .
 
 
Operators of essential services and relevant digital service providers
The  (NIS Regulations) which came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the  (also known as the NIS Directive). They have potential impact on:
 
Any operator of essential services (OES) that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure.
Relevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).
Like the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.
 
The banking and financial market infrastructures sectors were omitted from the NIS Regulations although they fall within the Cybersecurity Directive. The UK government stated in its consultation on implementation of the Directive that competent authorities for these sectors would not be identified. Firms and financial market infrastructure within these sectors must continue to adhere to requirements and standards as set by the Bank of England and/or the Financial Conduct Authority.
 
For a definition of an OES see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .
 
OESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OESs).
 
This agreement is drafted on the assumption that the NIS Regulations do not apply (either directly or indirectly). Where the NIS Regulations apply to the Customer, it will need to consider whether the obligations placed on the Supplier with regard to maintenance of the Customer’s hardware (and associated software) are sufficient to meet any enhanced cybersecurity requirements under the NIS Regulations. The National Cyber Security Centre has published  for OESs which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances.
 
The Customer should also refer to any specific guidance issued by the regulator for their specific OES sector (or by the ICO for RDSPs) and any applicable guidance for the banking and financial market infrastructures sectors, see .
 
Hardware maintenance can be a key way of protecting the Customer’s system from cybersecurity threats, and so (whether the NIS Regulations apply or not) the Customer may wish to place the Supplier under a specific obligation to maintain the security of any software which runs on the hardware, as well as its functional operation, see .
 
In addition, during hardware maintenance the Customer and Supplier systems may interface with each other, and so the Customer may want to impose an additional obligation on the Supplier not to introduce vulnerabilities into the Customer’s network and information systems. As drafted, currently only covers viruses.
 
For an example of additional cybersecurity requirements that could be included here (albeit in the context of software, rather than hardware, maintenance) see . Please note these requirements are general in nature and not aligned to any sectoral requirements, so if the NIS Regulations do apply, you should always consult the specific guidance that applies for your sector.
 
Consumer connectable products
Manufacturers, distributors and importers of certain consumer connectable in the UK (such as certain, qualifying smart products, like smart TVs, smart speakers, connected baby monitors and connected alarm systems) are subject to minimum cybersecurity requirements under Part 1 of the  (PSTIA). A party who is subject to these requirements might seek to include specific clauses in its maintenance arrangements with third parties to ensure that the cybersecurity of such products are preserved.
 
For more information on the requirements of the PSTIA, see .
 
Data protection
 
Where  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at , or, alternatively, a data protection schedule will need to be annexed to this agreement.
 
The clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.
 
For some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:
 
.
.
Each set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.
 
For a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .
 
Supply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking
 
The  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.
 
The Supplier should note that the Customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the Supplier will comply with the Customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the Supplier may require the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.
 
For further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .
  
Drafting for Brexit
 
On 31 January 2020 (), the UK left the EU and the UK-EU withdrawal agreement entered into force. Following the end of the  at 11.00 pm UK time on 31 December 2020,  was created, the remaining withdrawal agreement provisions came into operation, and the  (including the UK-EU trade and co-operation agreement) started to apply on a provisional basis, eventually entering into force at 11.00 pm (UK time) on 30 April 2021. This resource has been reviewed and reflects the position from the end of the transition period.

**i.** the neglect or misuse of the Maintained Equipment; or

**j.** use of Unsupported Software.

   Design defects in the Maintained Equipment (optional)
 
It should be considered whether parts (a) and (b) are appropriate in the circumstances, particularly where the Supplier is also the manufacturer of the Maintained Equipment, or where the Customer simply wants the hardware fixed, as part of the standard maintenance fees, notwithstanding that the error may be a result of an original design defect. The Customer may want the Supplier to address any defect that is detected, subject to it being compensated for the price of any spare parts in accordance with . The Supplier may very well resist this, however.

   Excluded Maintenance:  any maintenance services required to restore any malfunctioning or failed Maintained Equipment [or Supported Software] to Good Working Order where the malfunction or failure results from or is caused by any of the Excluded Causes.

   Emergency Maintenance:

**a.** making any adjustments to the Maintained Equipment; and

   Initial Period:  a period of [12] months commencing on the Commencement Date.

   Location:  the location of the Maintained Equipment as specified in  of , or any other location as may be agreed by the parties in writing from time to time.

   Location
 
A key concept within any hardware maintenance contract, is the location where the Supplier needs to attend to perform the Maintenance Services. This may be as simple as a certain specified address. However in more complex arrangements, such as Edge Computing deployments (see ), the Maintained Equipment may be spread across a number of locations, and potentially some difficult to access locations. Consideration should be given to whether the provisions referencing Location and associated response times are appropriate for these Locations.

   Maintained Equipment:  the equipment specified  of .

   Maintenance Services:  Preventative Maintenance, Corrective Maintenance and Emergency Maintenance of the Maintained Equipment [together with the Software Maintenance Services].

   Maintenance services
 
If the scope of the maintenance services will also cover supporting any software that is installed on the maintained equipment than the optional wording should also be included, see .

   [Mandatory Policies:  the [Customer’s OR Supplier’s] business policies [and codes] [attached OR listed] in , as amended by notification to the [Supplier OR Customer] from time to time.]

   Mandatory Policies (optional)
 
This definition relates to the optional compliance requirement at .which offers two drafting options. The first is a requirement on the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s policies, and the second is a requirement on the Supplier to comply with the Customer’s policies. Ensure that this definition is consistent with the approach taken in .
 
See further the integrated drafting notes at  and also  above.

   Operating Manuals:  all operating manuals and specifications relating to the Maintained Equipment which are provided to the Customer by the Supplier.

   Preventative Maintenance:  means:

**a.** testing that the Maintained Equipment is functional; and

**b.** making any adjustments as may be required to ensure the Maintained Equipment remains in Good Working Order,

   in accordance with .

   Renewal Period:  each successive 12-month period after the Initial Period for which this agreement is renewed.

   Representatives:  has the meaning given to it in .

   Response Time:  the applicable response times as set out in  of .

   [Service Credits:  the service credits specified in  of .]

   [Service Levels:  the levels to which the Supplier must perform the Maintenance Services, as set out in  of .]

   [Software:  any software which is made available by Supplier to Customer, including the firmware installed on the Hardware, ]and any updates to such software provided from time to time.]

   [Software Maintenance Services:  the software maintenance services to be provided by the Supplier in respect of the Supported Software as set out in  of .]

   Software maintenance services (optional)
 
It is becoming increasing likely that hardware will come with some form of software (including certain pre-installed software (often referred to as firmware)).
 
The support offered for software will depend on the hardware being maintained, whether the Supplier is the manufacturer of the hardware, and the other support obligations.
 
Manufacturers will generally provide patches (minor updates to fix bugs) for free and may provider other major updates for free or for a fee. There may also be urgent security patches where a critical vulnerability is identified.
 
Software within hardware will often not be supported forever, but will come with an advertised shelf life, or will be maintained subject to an “end of life” notice being provided by the manufacturer.
 
The availability of patches or updates without charge does not mean the Supplier will install them for free. So, in the context of this agreement, the parties should consider who is responsible for all activities to do with the maintenance and support of the software and the commercial impact of those being provided, including the following:
 
Support services (support desk, response and resolution).
Monitoring the availability of patches, updates and security issues;
Notifying the other party of the availability of patches, updates and security issues;
Applying and installing patches and updates from time to time; and
Applying and installing urgent security patches from time to time.
If the Supplier is to take on any of these tasks, then the definition of “software maintenance services” should be retained, and the scope, and detail, of the services should be set out in  of .
 
If the Customer retains any of these responsibilities but fails, then consider if that should be an excluded cause (see ) or otherwise limit Supplier’s liability (for example if any form of hardware warranty is provided, would that be subject to damage caused by a failure to patch (for example due to overheating).
 
If the hardware does not contain any software then all references to software, and software maintenance services, in this agreement can be removed.
 
For example software maintenance agreements, see  and .

   Standard Maintenance Fees:  the fees set out in  of , as these fees are varied from time to time in accordance with the terms of this agreement.

   [Supported Software:  Software that is both:]

**a.** Specified in  of  as Supported Software.

**b.** Currently supported by [Supplier OR the manufacture of the Maintained Equipment] [as detailed in  of ].

   Term:  the Initial Period together with all Renewal Periods.

   [Unsupported Software:  Software that is not Supported Software.]

   VAT:  value added tax imposed by the Value Added Tax Act 1994 [or any similar tax] chargeable in the UK [or elsewhere].

   VAT
 
Unless the parties are confident there will be no UK VAT or equivalent sales tax, it is recommended they retain the wording “or elsewhere” in the document.

   Virus:  any program which contains malicious code or infiltrates or damages a computer system without the owner’s informed consent or is designed to do so or which is hostile, intrusive or annoying to the owner or user and has no legitimate purpose.

   1.2  Clause, Schedule and paragraph headings shall not affect the interpretation of this agreement.

   1.3  A person includes a natural person, corporate or unincorporated body (whether or not having separate legal personality).

   1.4  The Schedules form part of this agreement and shall have effect as if set out in full in the body of this agreement. Any reference to this agreement includes the Schedules.

   1.5  A reference to a company shall include any company, corporation or other body corporate, wherever and however incorporated or established.

   1.6  Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular shall include the plural and in the plural shall include the singular.

   1.7  Unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to one gender shall include a reference to the other genders.

   1.8  A reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time.

   1.9  A reference to a statute or statutory provision shall include all subordinate legislation made from time to time under that statute or statutory provision.

   1.10  A reference to writing or written excludes faxes [and email OR but not e-mail].

   Reference to writing
 
Care should be taken to ensure the approach in this  aligns with the approach taken in .

   1.11  References to clauses and Schedules are to the clauses and Schedules of this agreement and references to paragraphs are to paragraphs of the relevant Schedule.

   1.12  Any words following the terms including, include, in particular, for example or any similar expression shall be interpreted as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those terms.

   1.13  If there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions in the main body of this agreement and the Schedules, the provisions in the main body of this agreement shall prevail.

   2.  MAINTENANCE SERVICES

   Maintenance Services
 
This clause sets out the three main types of Maintenance Services being provided by the Supplier under this agreement. These are:
 
Preventative Maintenance. This is where the Supplier attends the Customer’s premises to assess the Maintained Equipment with the objective of pre-empting any potential problems with it, and also repairing any Maintained Equipment which has failed and gone unnoticed or which is not operating as it should. Consider how frequently the Supplier will be required to carry out these pre-emptive visits.
Corrective Maintenance. This is where the Supplier attends the Customer’s premises to repair the Maintained Equipment in response to a Customer’s request. The key distinction between Corrective Maintenance and Emergency Maintenance is that Corrective Maintenance is performed during Normal Business Hours and (subject to  and ) is included in the fixed Standard Maintenance Fee. The parties will need to consider and agree the level of commitment that the Supplier will give in relation to any Response Time and Fix Time Service Levels. Will these be firm commitments, or will they be given on a reasonable endeavours basis only?
Emergency Maintenance. This is where the Supplier attends the Customer’s premises outside Normal Business Hours and, as such, is charged at the Additional Services Rates.
 
Software support
 
If the Supplier is providing any software support services then consider what will be done as part of the above elements of the maintenance services (such as who is responsible for regular patching and installing updates and whether this forms part of the Supplier’s services or should be a Customer responsibility and therefore an Excluded Cause), see .

   2.1  During the Term, the Supplier shall provide the Customer with the Maintenance Services.

   2.2  The Supplier shall [every [NUMBER] weeks OR at a frequency as is reasonably determined by the Supplier] perform Preventative Maintenance of the Maintained Equipment. Where the Supplier wishes to attend the Location in order to perform Preventative Maintenance, it shall do so during Normal Business Hours.

   2.3  On the Customer informing the Supplier that the Maintained Equipment is malfunctioning or has failed or is otherwise not in Good Working Order, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  [use all reasonable endeavours to] perform Corrective Maintenance of the Maintained Equipment within the relevant Fix Time; and

   (b)  where, in the Supplier’s opinion, it cannot reasonably perform Corrective Maintenance remotely, [use all reasonable endeavours to] attend at the Location during Normal Business Hours within the relevant Response Time.

   2.4  On the Customer informing the Supplier outside of Normal Business Hours that the Maintained Equipment is malfunctioning, has failed or is not in Good Working Order, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  [use all reasonable endeavours to] perform Emergency Maintenance of the Maintained Equipment within the relevant Fix Time; and

   (b)  where, in the Supplier’s opinion, it cannot reasonably perform Emergency Maintenance remotely, [use all reasonable endeavours to] attend at the Location within the relevant Response Time.

   2.5  Emergency Maintenance shall be charged at the Additional Services Rates for each of the Supplier’s personnel involved in the performance of Emergency Maintenance. Any additional charges shall be calculated, in the case of Emergency Maintenance that is performed remotely, from the time at which the relevant Supplier personnel commence performance of Emergency Maintenance, and in the case of Emergency Maintenance that is performed at the Location, from when the personnel arrive at the Location until they leave the Location.

   2.6  In performing any Maintenance Services, the Supplier shall [use all reasonable endeavours to] restore any malfunctioning or failed Maintained Equipment to Good Working Order either remotely or while in attendance at the Location. Where this is not reasonably practicable, or not reasonably practicable within Normal Business Hours (in the case of Preventative Maintenance and Corrective Maintenance), the Supplier shall either arrange for a further visit to the Location within Normal Business Hours to complete the repair, or remove the Maintained Equipment or part of the Maintained Equipment for repair off-site.

   2.7  The Supplier shall procure that its personnel shall, while on site at the Location, comply with the Customer’s reasonable health and safety and security policies provided that these policies have been brought to the attention of its personnel [in writing in advance].

   2.8  [The Supplier shall not be required to perform any maintenance or support in relation to either:

   (a)  Unsupported Software.

   (b)  Supported Software where Customer is in breach of [this agreement or ]the relevant EULA.]

   3.  [SERVICE LEVELS

   Service Levels
 
The parties may wish to include a Service Level regime to measure the Supplier’s performance under the agreement. In a hardware maintenance agreement, the Service Level measurements most commonly used are the Response Times and the Fix Times. The target response and resolution times will typically vary, depending on the severity of the problem. Severity categories, together with the applicable Response Times and Fix Times, should be documented in .
 
Where Service Levels apply, the Customer will normally expect these to be backed by some form of Service Credit regime, under which the Customer is entitled to a partial refund of maintenance charges if the Supplier fails to meet the Service Levels in any given measurement period (normally monthly or quarterly).
 
Take care to ensure that any Service Credits are not set at a punitive level to avoid the risk of unenforceability. For more information, see .
 
Consider if and to the extent software should be covered in, or excluded from, the service level regime, see .

   3.1  The Supplier shall [use reasonable endeavours to] perform the Maintenance Services in accordance with the Service Levels.

   3.2  The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a report, on a monthly basis [and in a form to be agreed with the Customer], setting out the Supplier’s performance against the Service Levels in the immediately preceding month.

   3.3  If the Supplier fails to perform the Maintenance Services in accordance with the Service Levels, the Supplier shall, without prejudice to the Customer’s other rights and remedies:

   (a)  arrange all additional resources necessary to perform the Maintenance Services in accordance with the Service Levels as soon as possible and at no additional charge to the Customer; and

   (b)  credit the Customer with the Service Credits, which shall take effect as an adjustment to the Standard Maintenance Fee.

   3.4  The parties agree that the value of the Service Credits is proportionate when considering the Customer’s legitimate interest to avoid any delay or deficiency in the maintenance of the Maintained Equipment.]

   4.  REPLACEMENTS AND SPARE PARTS

   Replacements and spare parts
 
It may not always be possible or economically viable for the Supplier to repair hardware that has failed. The agreement therefore needs to address the financial consequences of hardware failures which require spare or replacement parts. For example, are the costs of replacement/spare parts included within the Standard Maintenance Fees or are they subject to an additional charge?
 
Some Customers will prefer to include these costs in the Standard Maintenance Fees on the basis that this will give greater budgetary certainty as to overall hardware maintenance costs, although this will be reflected in a higher maintenance charge. Fixing the fees in this way may also encourage the Supplier to maintain the Maintained Equipment to a higher standard than might otherwise be the case (as they cannot levy an additional charge for replacement hardware).

   4.1  In performing the Preventative Maintenance, Corrective Maintenance and the Additional Services, the Supplier shall [use all reasonable endeavours to] source spare parts required to restore the Maintained Equipment to Good Working Order. Where the Supplier can reasonably source individual spare parts for less than £[AMOUNT] excluding VAT, the Supplier shall not charge the Customer for the spare parts. Where the Supplier is unable to source individual spare parts for less than this amount, the Supplier shall have the right to charge the Customer for the spare parts.

   4.2  All spare parts and/or replacements provided by the Supplier to the Customer shall become part of the Maintained Equipment [and the property of the Customer. The Supplier will assign to the Customer, with full title guarantee and free from all third-party rights, all spare parts and/or replacements provided by the Supplier]. All parts and components removed from the Maintained Equipment by the Supplier in the course of performing the Preventative Maintenance, Corrective Maintenance and/or the Additional Services shall no longer constitute part of the Maintained Equipment [and will be the property of the Supplier. The Customer will assign to the Supplier, with full title guarantee and free from all third-party rights, all parts and components removed from the Maintained Equipment by the Supplier in accordance with this ]. [For the purposes of this sub-clause, ‘assign’ includes ‘transfer ownership of’.]

   5.  CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS

   Customer’s obligations
 
This clause contains a number of obligations on the Customer which, from the Supplier’s standpoint, are intended to reduce the amount of Corrective Maintenance or Emergency Maintenance required. Many of these are relatively standard Customer obligations. However, the implications of each will need to be carefully considered.
 
In particular,  (which prevents anyone other than the Supplier maintaining or making changes to the Maintained Equipment),  (which prevents the Customer from moving the equipment without the Supplier’s prior written consent), and  (which requires the Customer to use only materials that have been supplied or approved by the Supplier) each require careful consideration, particularly in the context of any outsourcing arrangements that the Customer has entered into (or is planning to enter into). They will not be appropriate in many cases.

   The Customer shall:

   (a)  ensure that the Maintained Equipment is installed and kept at the Location, under suitable conditions, as specified in [the agreement under which the Maintained Equipment was supplied OR the Operating Manuals], and permit only trained and competent personnel to use it and follow any operating instructions as the Supplier may give from time to time;

   (b)  notify the Supplier promptly if the Maintained Equipment is discovered to be operating incorrectly.

   (c)  at all reasonable times permit full and free access to the Location and to the Maintained Equipment to the Supplier, its employees, contractors and agents, and provide them with adequate and safe working space, and any telecommunications facilities as are reasonably required to enable the Supplier to perform the Maintenance Services and the Additional Services while at the Location;

   (d)  provide the Supplier with any information that is reasonably requested in the performance of the Maintenance Services and the Additional Services;

   (e)  take any steps reasonably necessary to ensure the safety of the Supplier’s personnel when attending the Location;

   (f)  not allow any person other than the Supplier to maintain, alter, modify or adjust the Maintained Equipment without the prior written approval of the Supplier;

   (g)  not move the Maintained Equipment from the Location without the prior written approval of the Supplier (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

   (h)  store any reserve equipment only in conditions approved by the Supplier, and make this equipment available for periodic maintenance, as with all other Maintained Equipment; [and]

   (i)  only use supplies or materials supplied or approved by the Supplier (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)[; and]

   (j)  [only use the Software in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the EULA.]

   6.  EXCLUDED MAINTENANCE

   Excluded Maintenance
 
This clause needs careful review by both parties as it effectively defines the scope of the hardware Maintenance Services (and the circumstances in which those Maintenance Services will be provided) as part of the Standard Maintenance Fees.
 
From the Supplier’s point of view, it protects them from having to provide Maintenance Services in relation to failures or malfunctions which are the fault of the Customer (for example, damage caused by moving equipment or a failure to use required environmental controls). From the Customer’s point of view, careful attention needs to be paid to ensure that the exclusions are not too broad, in turn significantly reducing the circumstances in which maintenance will be provided as part of the Standard Maintenance Fees.
 
As drafted, where maintenance is required for any of the reasons set out in the definition of , additional charges will be applied.

   6.1  The Supplier is not obliged to perform any Excluded Maintenance.

   6.2  Where the Supplier is performing or has performed the Maintenance Services in circumstances where it is established that the Maintained Equipment was not in Good Working Order due to any of the Excluded Causes, the Supplier may charge, and the Customer shall pay, the Additional Services Fees in respect of that work.

   7.  CHARGES

   Charges
 
There are three types of fees payable under this agreement:
 
Standard Maintenance Fees. These are payable in respect of Preventative Maintenance and Corrective Maintenance (and, where applicable, the Software Maintenance Services) performed during Normal Business Hours. The applicable payment terms (that is, when the fees will be payable and at what intervals) need to be agreed and documented in .
Additional Services Fees. These are payable in respect of any Emergency Maintenance and any Excluded Maintenance. Additional Services Fees are calculated in accordance with the rates set out in  and, as currently drafted, are payable in arrear on a monthly basis.
Fees for spare parts. These charges are payable where the threshold set out in  is exceeded.

   7.1  For the performance of Corrective Maintenance and Preventative Maintenance [and Software Maintenance Services], the Customer shall pay to the Supplier the Standard Maintenance Fees.

   7.2  For the performance of any Additional Services, the Customer shall pay to the Supplier the Additional Services Fees.

   7.3  The Standard Maintenance Fees and the Additional Services Fees shall be inclusive of all expenses, other than those recoverable in accordance with , and the Supplier shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in providing the Maintenance Services (other than those recoverable in accordance with ).

   7.4  The Standard Maintenance Fees shall be due and payable in full to the Supplier [annually in advance], within [30] days of receipt of a valid invoice from the Supplier. Any Additional Services Fees shall be due and payable monthly, within [30] days of receipt of a valid invoice from the Supplier. Any charges for spare parts recoverable in accordance with  shall be due within [30] days of receipt of a valid invoice from the Supplier.

   7.5  If the Customer fails to make any payment due to the Supplier under this agreement by the due date for payment, then[, without limiting the Supplier’s remedies under , the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [4]% per annum above [FULL NAME OF BANK]’s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.

   7.6  All payments made by the Customer under this agreement are exclusive of VAT, which shall be paid by the Customer at the rate and in the manner for the time being prescribed by law. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a valid VAT invoice.

   7.7  [The Customer shall pay any stamp duties or similar transfer taxes imposed on the supplies made under this agreement and shall reimburse the Supplier for any such stamp duties or similar transfer taxes paid by the Supplier. If the Customer is required to make any deduction for or on account of tax from any payment due under this agreement (Tax Deduction):

   (a)  The Customer shall account to the relevant tax authority for such Tax Deduction and shall provide evidence to the Supplier that it has so accounted.

   (b)  The amount of the payment due under this Agreement shall be increased so that the Supplier receives an amount equal to the amount that would have been received by it, had the Customer not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   The Customer and the Supplier shall co-operate to minimise the amount of any Tax Deduction. If following the making of a Tax Deduction, the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion OR acting in good faith] that it (or any member of the Supplier’s group) has received and retained any credit, relief or other benefit as a result of the Tax Deduction, the Supplier shall pay such amount to the Customer as the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion OR acting in good faith] would leave the Supplier in the same position as if the Customer had not been required to make any Tax Deduction.]

   Tax deductions and withholding (optional)
 
In international supply agreements, for example where the customer and supplier are located in different countries, consideration should be given as to whether the short provision in  is sufficient by itself, or whether it may be necessary to have additional wording to deal with taxation issues that only arise in international contexts, (such as transfer taxes and tax withholding).  is an optional clause that can be used for tax withholding where required. It is always advisable to obtain expert tax advice on the structuring of payments before any agreement is entered into. For further guidance on tax deductions and withholding, see .

   7.8  The Supplier may, at any time after the [first] anniversary of the Commencement Date, increase the Standard Maintenance Fees and the Additional Services Rates by giving to the Customer not less than [three] months written notice, provided that:

   (a)  the increase shall not exceed a percentage equal to the percentage increase in [the Consumer Prices Index (All Items) OR SPECIFY INDEX] published by the Office for National Statistics (or its successor from time to time) for the period from the Commencement Date (in the case of the first increase) or the date on which the immediately preceding increase came into effect pursuant to this clause (in the case of the second or any subsequent increase) up to the date of this notice; and

   (b)  the increases shall be no more frequent than once in any 12-month period.

   Increasing the standard maintenance fees
 
 sets out a mechanism under which the Supplier can increase the Standard Maintenance Fees and the Additional Services Rates during the Term of the Agreement. The clause envisages that there will be an Initial Period following the Commencement Date in which those charges may not be increased. Thereafter, the Supplier is entitled to increase the Charges once in any 12-month period in line with any increases to the consumer price indexes in the preceding 12-month period.
 
For other indices you might use for annual increases, see .

   8.  SUPPLIER WARRANTIES

   Supplier warranties
 
This clause sets out fairly standard supplier warranties, exclusions and obligations. Specifically, the Supplier undertakes that:
 
The services will be performed substantially in accordance with reasonable skill and care and/or in accordance with Good Industry Practice.
Appropriate skilled and qualified personnel of sufficient number will perform the services in accordance with applicable laws.
Any equipment supplied will operate in accordance with their technical specifications.
 is included to negate all other terms which may otherwise be implied by law (such as those implied terms set out in the  and the ) so as to limit the extent and scope of the Supplier’s warranties to those set out in this  and elsewhere in the agreement.

   8.1  The Supplier represents and warrants to the Customer that:

   (a)  the Maintenance Services and the Additional Services shall be performed:

   (i)  by an appropriate number of suitably qualified and experienced personnel;

   (ii)  using all reasonable skill and care [and in accordance with Good Industry Practice]; and

   (iii)  in accordance with all laws and regulations in force from time to time which are applicable to the Supplier.

   Compliance with applicable laws
 
When acting for the Supplier, you should be careful to ensure that any obligation to comply with applicable laws, is limited to those laws that are applicable to the Supplier and not the Customer.
 
This will be particularly important where the Customer is subject to the NIS Regulations, and is required to maintain a higher standard of cybersecurity, and business continuity, than would otherwise apply to other business sectors, see .
 
A supplier may want to make it clear that any such heightened cybersecurity requirements do not apply to it (for an example of such a disclaimer, in the context of a software licence, see .
 
On the other hand, the Customer may well want to flow down any such heightened cybersecurity requirements to its supplier who is responsible for maintaining its hardware (a failure of which may have serious security consequences for the Customer). In such case, the Supplier is likely to require clear and precise obligations to be set out in this agreement rather than to be forced to interpret what these standards might be by virtue of agreeing to a broad compliance with law clause.

   (b)  [all components and equipment supplied or used in the course of the provision of the Maintenance Services and the Additional Services shall operate materially in accordance with their technical specifications;]

   (c)  the Supplier has the full capacity and authority and all necessary permissions, licences and consents necessary to enter into, and perform its obligations under, this agreement;

   (d)  the Supplier shall [take reasonable steps to] not introduce any Viruses into the Maintained Equipment, or the Customer’s network and information systems, by way of the Maintenance Services or the Additional Services or otherwise.

   8.2  Except as expressly stated in this agreement, all warranties, conditions and terms, whether express or implied by statute, common law or otherwise (including satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and suitability) are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

   9.  LIABILITY

   Liability
 
For further discussion on negotiating limits of liability in maintenance agreements (although focused on software maintenance), see .
 
For more general information, see the following practice notes relating to limiting liability in B2B contracts:
 
.
 
.
 
.
 
.
 
The provisions relating to liability have been drafted on the basis that the parties are both commercial entities.
 
 states that death or personal injury arising from negligence cannot be excluded (,  (UCTA 1977)), nor can liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation ().  also states that the obligations implied by  of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and  of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 relating to title of property also are not excluded ( and , UCTA 1977).
 
 then seeks to exclude all loss that:
 
Constitutes loss of profits, business revenue or goodwill (whether direct or indirect).
Is loss or corruption of data or information (whether direct or indirect).
Is special, indirect or consequential.
The distinction between direct and indirect loss is not clear cut, and there is no easy formulation to determine on which side of the line a particular category or type of loss falls in any specific case. A particular difficulty arises when deciding whether loss of profits is direct or indirect. Recent case law has tended to hold that loss of profits can be a direct loss. In a limitation of liability clause such as this, if it is the parties’ intention to exclude all loss of profit, this needs to be done in a way that does not link lost profit with indirect loss. Otherwise, direct loss of profit is unlikely to be excluded, since exclusion clauses are interpreted by the courts contra proferentem, that is, against the person seeking to rely upon it.
 
Finally,  seeks to limit both parties’ aggregate liability under the contract to a pre-set sum, by reference to the greater of a multiple of the contract price or a fixed amount. As a general rule, if this is a contract to which  of UCTA 1977 potentially applies (that is, if it is, or could be considered to be, effectively on one party’s standard terms) then there is a risk that if the liability cap is significantly below the contract price, it could be held by the courts to be unreasonable (under the test laid down by UCTA 1977) and therefore unenforceable.
 
The charges multiple set out in  may conceivably produce a low sum and run the risk of being viewed as unreasonable and therefore unenforceable. To reduce this risk,  caps liability at the greater of the charges multiple and a fixed sum to be inserted into . The latter should be determined in accordance with established principles of what is a reasonable sum in the particular circumstances. If this provision is held to be unreasonable under UCTA 1977, damages would be recoverable without limitation, on the basis of the ordinary contract law rules of remoteness.
 
Depending on which formulation is chosen, these rules say that recoverable loss is either:
 
Loss which arises naturally from a breach or which may reasonably be supposed to have been in the parties’ contemplation when they made the contract as the probable result of a breach (the classic formulation in .
All loss which, at the time the contract was made, was reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach ().
It may be agreed that the Supplier’s liability will be unlimited in specific circumstances. Common exceptions include breach of confidentiality (), The Supplier’s attitude is likely to depend on the nature of the services to be provided, and the types of confidential information it may have access to in the course of its maintenance.
 
The Customer might want to state that the Supplier’s liability in relation to compliance with any cybersecurity obligations (including where these place the Customer in breach of the NIS Regulations, if applicable, see ) or data protection obligations (see ) should not be subject to the Supplier’s liability cap. At the very least, the parties should consider, when setting the cap, that a fine for breaches of this legislation could be very substantial. For further discussion on this topic, see .
 
Where software is provided you will also want to consider whether an IP indemnity should be included, and whether that should be uncapped (and subject to a conduct of claims provision), see .

   9.1  Neither party excludes or limits liability to the other party for:

   (a)  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;

   (b)  death or personal injury caused by negligence; or

   (c)  a breach of any obligations implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.

   9.2  Subject always to , neither party shall be liable whether in contract, tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, for:

   (a)  any loss (whether direct or indirect) of profits, business, revenue, or goodwill;

   (b)  [loss or corruption (whether direct or indirect) of data or information; or]

   Excluding the Supplier’s liability for loss or corruption of data
 
The Customer may wish to resist such an exclusion, particularly where the Supplier will be responsible for maintaining hardware which stores business critical information, or personal data (see ) or where the Customer is subject to the NIS Regulations (see ).

   (c)  any special, indirect or consequential loss, costs, damages, charges or expenses,

   in each case, however arising under this agreement.

   9.3  Subject always to , each party’s total aggregate liability in contract, tort (including negligence and breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance, contemplated performance, or non-performance of this agreement shall be limited to the greater of:

   (a)  £[AMOUNT]; and

   (b)  [PERCENTAGE]% of the total Charges paid by the Customer to the Supplier [during the [12-]month period immediately preceding the date on which the first cause of action under this agreement first arose].

   10.  CONFIDENTIALITY [AND COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES]

   Confidentiality
 
For more information, see the integrated drafting notes to .
 
 
Compliance with policies

   10.1  Confidential Information means all confidential information (however recorded or preserved) disclosed by a party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the other party and that party’s Representatives [whether before or] [after the date of this agreement] in connection with this agreement or the Maintenance Services including but not limited to:

   (a)  [the [existence and] terms of this agreement [or any agreement entered into in connection with this agreement];]

   (b)  any information that would be regarded as confidential by a reasonable business person relating to:

   (i)  the business, assets, affairs, customers, clients, suppliers, [or] plans [, intentions, or market opportunities] of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)]; and

   (ii)  the operations, processes, product information, know-how, designs, trade secrets or software of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)];

   (c)  any information developed by the parties in the course of carrying out this agreement; and

   (d)  any information detailed in Schedule [NUMBER].

   Representatives means, in relation to a party, its employees, officers, contractors, subcontractors, representatives and advisers.

   10.2  The provisions of this clause shall not apply to any Confidential Information that:

   (a)  is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in breach of this clause);

   (b)  was available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before disclosure by the disclosing party;

   (c)  was, is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a person who, to the receiving party’s knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party or otherwise prohibited from disclosing the information to the receiving party; [or]

   (d)  the parties agree in writing is not confidential or may be disclosed[; or]

   (e)  [is developed by or for the receiving party independently of the information disclosed by the disclosing party.]

   10.3  Each party shall keep the other party’s Confidential Information secret and confidential and shall:

   (a)  not use any Confidential Information except [for the purpose of exercising or performing its rights and obligations under or in connection with this agreement OR [SPECIFY PURPOSE]] (Permitted Purpose); or

   (b)  not disclose such Confidential Information in whole or in part to any third party, except as expressly permitted by this .

   (a)  [not process the Confidential Information in any way using machine learning or artificial intelligence (“AI”) models OR only process the Confidential Information using machine learning or artificial intelligence (“AI”) models where those models will not be:

   (i)  trained on the Confidential Information; and

   (ii)  lawfully available to or accessible for use by any person or entity except for a party or its Representatives.

   ]

   AI and machine learning (optional)
 
The specific requirements of a confidentiality clause can vary with the type of information being shared and its intended purpose. However, with AI use becoming ever more prevalent in a commercial context, practitioners should expressly address the parties’ potential use of AI and machine learning, including how this interfaces with the need to protect the confidential information disclosed.
 
Choose from the following two drafting options:
 
Option 1. Unless there is a transaction-specific reason to permit it, a confidentiality clause should prohibit the use of the other party’s confidential information by AI or machine learning models (whether private or public facing). This broad prohibition also prevents use of the disclosed confidential information to train such models. Particularly with a public facing AI model (for example, Chat GPT), this helps address the risk that a party’s confidential information may be used to train the model to respond to future queries by members of the public, and so lead to potential data leakage (unauthorised disclosure to third parties). The first drafting option at  reflects this approach.
Option 2. If either or both parties are unable to agree to a blanket prohibition on disclosure of the confidential information to AI or machine learning models, for example because the proposed commercial transaction envisages use of AI, the confidentiality clause should expressly provide for that. In these circumstances, practitioners should also consider imposing a condition on the recipient of the discloser’s confidential information that any such information fed into the AI model will not be used to train it, and that the AI model is not accessible to or available for use by anyone that is not already allowed to access the confidential information under the agreement. Choose the second drafting option at  if taking this approach.
It should be noted that  may not favour IT suppliers (who may, typically, be the most likely to want to use customer information to train AI models) so this clause has been made optional.
 
For further information on AI and confidentiality, see .

   ]

   10.4  A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to those of its Representatives who need to know that Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, provided that:

   (a)  it informs such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information before disclosure; and

   (b)  at all times, it is responsible for the Representatives’ compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in this .

   10.5  A party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, by any governmental or other regulatory authority [(including, without limitation, [ANY RELEVANT SECURITIES EXCHANGES])] or by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction provided that, to the extent it is legally permitted to do so, it gives the other party as much notice of such disclosure as possible [and, where notice of disclosure is not prohibited and is given in accordance with this , it takes into account the reasonable requests of the other party in relation to the content of such disclosure].

   10.6  Each party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights or obligations in respect of a party’s Confidential Information, other than those expressly stated in this agreement, are granted to the other party, or are to be implied from this agreement.

   10.7  [The provisions of this  shall [continue to apply after termination [or expiry] of this agreement OR survive for a period of [five] years from termination [or expiry] of this agreement].]

   10.8  [Except as expressly stated in this agreement, no party makes any express or implied warranty or representation concerning its Confidential Information.]

   10.9  [A party may, provided that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party is involved in activity that may constitute a criminal offence under the Bribery Act 2010, disclose Confidential Information to the Serious Fraud Office without first informing the other party of such disclosure.]

   10.10  [In performing its obligations under this agreement the [Supplier OR Customer] shall comply with the Mandatory Policies.]

   Compliance with policies
 
 can be used where the Customer or Supplier has specific business policies and wants to ensure that the other party complies with them. The policies might reflect a party’s legal obligations, for instance, its obligations under instruments such as the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (see ) the Bribery Act 2010, or data protection legislation (see ). Alternatively, a party may have adopted business social responsibility policies voluntarily.
 
In most goods or services agreements, the obligation is usually on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. But this may not always be the case: depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, a supplier may well require the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies instead. As this is a pro-supplier agreement, the Supplier may want to omit this clause altogether from the first draft provided to the Customer.
 
If the Supplier does choose to include this clause, there are two drafting options:
 
The first is a requirement on the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s policies. This is slightly unusual (the usual position is that a supplier agrees to comply with its customer’s policies), but a supplier who is concerned about its reputation may well want to ensure that it is only supplying goods or services to customers who are willing to comply with the supplier’s policies on issues such as anti-bribery, modern slavery and ethics, or cybersecurity.
The second option is a requirement on the Supplier to comply with the Customer’s policies. This is the more usual approach in a goods or services agreement. A supplier may include this option if, for instance, it has already agreed in principle that it is able to comply with its customer’s policies, or the parties already have an ongoing relationship where the supplier is comfortable with complying with the customer’s policies.
Whatever approach is taken, check that the definition of  above is consistent with the approach in this clause.
 
Note also that if the Customer agrees to comply with the Supplier’s policies, the Supplier may want a subsequent right to terminate the agreement if the Customer breaches those policies. If this is desired, the Supplier could include this additional right to terminate at . For an example of this, see .
 
For more information on general compliance clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   11.  TERM AND TERMINATION

   Term and termination
 
 provides for the agreement to last for the Initial Period, and after that for successive Renewal Periods, unless either party notifies the other of its intention to terminate the agreement at least 60 days before the end of the Initial Period or any subsequent Renewal Period. The Supplier and Customer should both consider whether 60 days is a sufficient period of time.
 
Each party has the right to terminate the contract in the event of the other’s insolvency or default ().
 
 sets out fairly standard provisions for the consequences of termination in this kind of agreement (that is, return of the other party’s property and documentation and payment of outstanding amounts).  obliges the Supplier to provide a degree of transitional assistance upon termination. Customers may want to consider making these obligations more defined and extensive. Suppliers may wish to remove this provision completely or make it optional at the request of the Customer but subject to additional charges.
 
For further information, see  and associated drafting notes, including information on the , which came into force on 26 June 2020. See also  and, in particular,  and the commentary around  and .

   11.1  This agreement shall commence on the Commencement Date. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with this , this agreement shall continue for the Initial Period and shall automatically extend for a Renewal Period at the end of the Initial Period and at the end of each Renewal Period. Either party may give written notice to the other party, not later than [60 days] before the end of the Initial Period or the relevant Renewal Period, to terminate this agreement at the end of the Initial Period or the relevant Renewal Period, as the case may be.

   11.2  Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either party may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving [written] notice to the other party if:

   (a)  [the other party fails to pay any amount due under this agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than [NUMBER] days after being notified [in writing] to make such payment;]

   (b)  the other party commits a material breach of any [other] term of this agreement and (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of [NUMBER] days after being notified [in writing] to do so;

   (c)  [the other party repeatedly breaches any of the terms of this agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement;]

   (d)  the other party suspends, or threatens to suspend, payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or admits inability to pay its debts or [(being a company or limited liability partnership) is deemed unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986) as if the words “it is proved to the satisfaction of the court” did not appear in sections 123(1)(e) or 123(2) of the IA 1986 OR (being an individual) is deemed either unable to pay its debts or as having no reasonable prospect of so doing, in either case, within the meaning of section 268 of the IA 1986 OR (being a partnership) has any partner to whom any of the foregoing apply];

   (e)  the other party commences negotiations with all or any class of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its debts, or makes a proposal for or enters into any compromise or arrangement with any of its creditors [other than (being a company) for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (f)  the other party applies to court for, or obtains, a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986;

   (g)  a petition is filed, a notice is given, a resolution is passed, or an order is made, for or in connection with the winding up of the other party (being a company, limited liability partnership or partnership) [other than for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (h)  an application is made to court, or an order is made, for the appointment of an administrator, or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given or an administrator is appointed, over the other party (being a company, partnership or limited liability partnership);

   (i)  the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of that other party (being a company or limited liability partnership) has become entitled to appoint or has appointed an administrative receiver;

   (j)  a person becomes entitled to appoint a receiver over all or any of the assets of the other party or a receiver is appointed over all or any of the assets of the other party;

   (k)  a creditor or encumbrancer of the other party attaches or takes possession of, or a distress, execution, sequestration or other such process is levied or enforced on or sued against, the whole or any part of the other party’s assets and such attachment or process is not discharged within [14] days;

   (l)  any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the other party in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events mentioned in  to  (inclusive);

   (m)  the other party suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business[; or]

   (n)  [the other party’s financial position deteriorates so far as to reasonably justify the opinion that its ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement is in jeopardy[; or]]

   (o)  [there is a change of control of the other party [(within the meaning of section 1124 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010)][; or]]

   (p)  [any warranty given by the other party in clause [NUMBER] of this agreement is found to be untrue or misleading.]

   11.3  [For the purposes of  a material breach [means OR includes]:

   (a)  a breach of any of the obligations set out in clauses [NUMBERS]; or

   (b)  a breach that has a serious effect on the benefit the terminating party would otherwise derive from this agreement [over any [NUMBER]-month period during its term].]

   Defining material breach (optional)
 
Consider carefully whether the agreement should include a definition for material breach, how that is defined, and whether that definition should be exhaustive. A definition which is too narrow or wide can make the termination trigger higher or lower than that which might be ordinarily expected. The definition may also not correctly anticipate the area(s) where a dispute ultimately arises. It is not unusual for English law governed contracts to leave this concept as undefined, despite this creating a degree of uncertainty as to when such a termination right may therefore arise. For further commentary on the meaning of material breach (where no definition is used) and related termination considerations, see .

   11.4  Any provision of this agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

   11.5  Termination of this agreement, for any reason, shall not affect the accrued rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties existing at termination, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the agreement which existed at or before the date of termination.

   11.6  On termination of this agreement for any reason;

   (a)  except as provided for in , each party shall as soon as reasonably practicable:

   (i)  return or destroy (or, in the case of electronic data, delete), as directed in writing by the other party, any documents, handbooks, CD-ROMs, DVDs, other tangible digital media or other information or data provided to it by the other party for the purposes of this agreement, including all documents and materials (and any copies) containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the other party’s Confidential Information. If required by the other party, it shall provide written evidence (in the form of a letter signed by its [RELEVANT OFFICER]) no later than [14] days after termination of this agreement that these have been destroyed or deleted and that it has not retained any copies of them, except for one copy that it may use for audit purposes only, and subject to the confidentiality obligations in ;

   (ii)  delete any proprietary software belonging to the other party and all the other party’s Confidential Information from its IT network and hard disks or other storage means associated with any computer equipment owned or controlled by that party. Each party shall provide written confirmation (in the form of a letter signed by its [RELEVANT OFFICER]) no later than [14] days after termination of this agreement that this software and Confidential Information has been deleted;

   (iii)  return all of the other party’s equipment and materials, failing which the other party may enter the relevant premises and take possession of them. Until these are returned or repossessed, the party remaining in possession shall be solely responsible for their safe-keeping;

   (b)  the Supplier shall provide all reasonable, transitional assistance to the Customer and/or any third party engaged by the Customer in connection with the maintenance and support of the Maintained Equipment; and

   (c)  the Customer shall immediately pay any outstanding amounts owed to the Supplier pursuant to this agreement.

   11.7  If a party is required by any applicable law or regulation, or government or regulatory body of competent jurisdiction to retain any documents or materials which it would otherwise be required to return or destroy under , it shall notify the other party in writing of that retention, giving details of the documents or materials that it must retain and the reasons for such retention, and it shall be entitled to retain such documents or materials for the period required by the relevant applicable law or regulation or government or regulatory body provided at all times that  shall continue to apply to any retained documents and materials.

   11.8  Electronic data shall be considered deleted, for the purposes of , where it has been put beyond use by the deleting party.

   Deletion of electronic data
 
It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to “delete” electronic data. The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK’s data protection authority) has opined that the term “deletion”, in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.
