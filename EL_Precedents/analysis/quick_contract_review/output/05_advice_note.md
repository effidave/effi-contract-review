## Email Body

Hi Anna,

 

I am very sorry for the delay.

 

Please see attached for my comments.  Things to flag:

 

*	AI/machine learning (3.3., Ex. 1)– please check my proposed wording in Exhibit 1 carefully, especially the statements on training data, use of NBC Data. Please also add details of any third party suppliers you use for this.
*	Subcontractors/suppliers/service providers (3.4) – please list these in Exhibit 1 if they will have access to any NBC Data – n.b. this would include cloud service providers who merely host NBC data. 
*	IP in outputs (4) – please let me know if they are only able to use the outputs during the term of the agreement.  At the moment, they own the IP in the outputs.
*	Affiliates (3.1) – are you happy for the entire NBC group to benefit from the trial?
*	Warranties/indemnities (3.2 and 9 and 10) – see my comments on whether to push back or accept.
*	Data security (8 and Ex. 3) – I have proposed to limit Exhibit 3 to clauses 6 (Data Retention and Descruction), 8 (Cyber Security Incidents) and 9 (Application and Software Requirements) which look reasonable (and probably align with your existing practices).  Please check these look ok – or let me know if you would like me to provide more detail on this.
*	Liability cap (11) – I have added a general liability cap (100% of the fees) and a supercap of $1m for the indemnity in clause 10 (i.e. IPR, confidentiality, security).
*	Payment terms (5) – I have amended from 75 to 45 days, as per your email.

 

I have availability today if you would like to discuss anything or if you would like me to edit anything.

 

If you are comfortable with these changes, please delete the internal comments, marked For Didimo.   The comments marked For NBC are safe for sharing with them.

 

Thanks,

		I am happy to advise Mydidimo UK Ltd on the basis that Mydidimo UK Ltd has been tasked by Didimo Inc. with getting advice on this agreement and that this makes sense for the group’s overall benefit. 

		 

		I will proceed on that basis unless you tell me otherwise.  

		 

		FYI, if it is easier for your internal cross-charging, I could open a file for Didimo Inc. and Didimo Inc. would be charged.  I don’t think that Didimo Inc would benefit from accrued hours, but I could check.

			Dear Anna,

			 

			It’s great to hear from you.  

			 

			I am almost certain we are not conflicted here – please can you let me know whether the instruction comes from Didimo Inc or MyDidimo UK Ltd?  Then I can open the file and get the conflict check confirmed.

			 

			Assuming that’s all fine, I am happy to help here.  As you have noted, I will need to caveat my advice based on governing law (i.e. I will advise as if the agreement was under the law of England and Wales). 

			 

			Your instructions below are all clear and your proposed edits make good sense to me.  Once the file is open, I will review the agreement get some high-level comments to you today on any other issues, so that you can feed back on the options for how to handle them.

			Subject: NBC Trail Contract Template

			 

			Dear David,

			 

			I hope you are well!

			 

			We recently received a Trial contract from NBC. Unfortunately, our US lawyers have a conflict of interest and cannot advise on this matter.

			 

			While this contract is governed by US law, we would greatly appreciate your initial comments on the risks from a general legal perspective. I have included my initial notes below, but please also highlight any other concerns or risks you perceive.

			 

			Here are the key points I initially noted. 

			 

			- 3.3 AI Use: We use machine learning in our software, but not Large Language Models (LLMs). Could you suggest clarifying language to add to Exhibit 1 regarding this distinction? 

			- 5.0 Fees (Payment Terms): The current payment term is 75 days. Since our standard term is 30 days, we would like to suggest a compromise of 45 days.

			- 10.0 Indemnification: The current language suggests unlimited liability. As a small startup, we need to cap this at $1 million, which is consistent with our current insurance limit.

			- Exhibit A Third-Party Security Standard: Given that we are not integrating with their system, I recommend limiting this section so that only a few specific and relevant clauses apply to us.

			 

			Thank you for your assistance with this and if you are able to advise as soon possible that would be very helpful. 

			 

			Thanks Anna
