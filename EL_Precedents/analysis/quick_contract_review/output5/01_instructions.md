## Email Body

Dear David,

I hope you are well!

We recently received a Trial contract from [SUPPLIER]. Unfortunately, our US lawyers have a conflict of interest and cannot advise on this matter.

While this contract is governed by US law, we would greatly appreciate your initial comments on the risks from a general legal perspective. I have included my initial notes below, but please also highlight any other concerns or risks you perceive.

Here are the key points I initially noted. 


- 3.3 AI Use: We use machine learning in our software, but not Large Language Models (LLMs). Could you suggest clarifying language to add to Exhibit 1 regarding this distinction?
- 5.0 Fees (Payment Terms): The current payment term is 75 days. Since our standard term is 30 days, we would like to suggest a compromise of 45 days.
- 10.0 Indemnification: The current language suggests unlimited liability. As a small startup, we need to cap this at $1 million, which is consistent with our current insurance limit.
- Exhibit A Third-Party Security Standard: Given that we are not integrating with their system, I recommend limiting this section so that only a few specific and relevant clauses apply to us.

Thank you for your assistance with this and if you are able to advise as soon possible that would be very helpful. 

Thanks Anna
