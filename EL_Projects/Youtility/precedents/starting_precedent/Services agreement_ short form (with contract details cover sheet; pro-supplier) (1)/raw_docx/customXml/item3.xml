If there are aspects of the transaction that are of particular importance or concern to the supplier and are not fully addressed in this short form document, relevant provisions from the long form agreement could be included.</paratext>

A service provision change can happen where a customer engages a supplier to provide services for the first time, or changes its supplier of services, or terminates a service contract and starts to perform services in-house. For full information on when TUPE will apply on a service provision change, see <link href="8-204-4041" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note, TUPE (3): service provision changes</ital></link>. If there is a risk that individuals may transfer to the supplier via TUPE when the services begin, the supplier should consider obtaining appropriate warranties and indemnities from the customer, for which see <link anchor="a960361" href="7-623-0751" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Standard document, Services agreement (pro-supplier): Schedule 6</ital></link>. A short form services agreement is often used where the services are relatively low value. In that scenario, there may not be an organised group whose main purpose is providing the services. For that reason, TUPE may not apply and we have not included TUPE clauses as standard in this agreement.</paratext>

In a pro-supplier agreement, the supplier may choose to omit compliance with policies from a first draft. If the supplier does include a commitment to comply with policies (for example, because customers frequently expect this), it may prefer to list its own business conduct policies. This should make compliance easier and remove the need for the supplier to review customer policies and check for differences with its own.</paratext>

In some agreements, the clause may then make exceptions to this exclusion, so that certain types of loss or specific losses are recoverable. For example, the agreement could specify that wasted expenditure in general is excluded but that certain specific costs are not. Or that loss of business in general is excluded but loss of a particular client or contract is not. As this is a pro-supplier agreement, there is no clause specifying losses that are not excluded (and therefore definitely recoverable) as this is usually for the customer's benefit.

If the supplier will be processing personal data on the customer's behalf, then the parties may want to include a separate cap for losses arising from data processing breaches. Given the potentially high fines under the UK GDPR, the supplier is likely to want a financial cap on its liability to the customer for data processing breaches. A customer that agrees to this is likely to want this cap to be separate from, and in addition to, the contract's overall liability cap. This avoids the risk that a data processing liability claim might exhaust all or most of a general cap, so that there is none left for other liabilities that are subsequently incurred. A separate cap for data protection breaches has become fairly common in services agreement. The supplier may need to offer it to prevent the customer insisting on unlimited liability instead.</paratext>
