An agreement for a new air traffic control system, for example, will have to deal with very different issues to those in an agreement for an upgraded payroll-account system. Indeed, there will be significant differences between agreements to upgrade the payroll-accounts system of a multinational company and those of a small, local firm.\n \nHowever, several features suitable for larger deals have been incorporated as options. These include provision for country-specific amendments, extension of the benefit of software and services to affiliates and various measures to increase supplier’s liability under the agreement. Some generic concepts such as affiliates, control and VAT/sales tax have also been included as alternatives to the UK-focused equivalents.\n \nOther features of the standard document include:\n \nData protection.\nData security breach.\nRestoration of lost or corrupted data.\nOwnership of data.\nProvisions relating to international technology export control.\nThe standard document illustrates the basic issues that need to be considered in all systems integration agreements that include some software modification or development. The development and modification of software are usually the hardest parts of the project to deal with in the agreement, and the most usual cause of disputes between suppliers and customers.\n \nThe standard document is generally drafted from the perspective of the supplier. However, both parties should regard it as being in their own interest to negotiate an agreement which is fairly balanced, as this will make the project more likely to proceed smoothly with few disputes. A party who feels that it has been forced into a bad bargain by the negotiating strength and leverage of the other party is more likely to be looking for a way out if things go wrong. There are almost always implementation problems when software development or integration is involved.\n \nFor more information on the issues that arise in the negotiation of systems integration agreements, see .\n \n \nAssumptions\n \nThis standard document is drafted on the following assumptions:\n \nThe supplier and the customer are private companies incorporated in England and Wales.\nThe supplier and the customer are limited companies, the agreement will be performed in the UK and the output from the agreement will be used in the UK.\nThe agreement is subject to English law.\nNo employees are intended to transfer as part of the systems integration project, and the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/246) (TUPE) do not apply. If there is a risk that TUPE applies, then this should be considered carefully and the agreement amended to reflect the risk. see  For more information on when TUPE may apply to service provision changes, as well as pro-supplier drafting to address the risks of TUPE applying on entry, see .\nNIS 2 and DORA do not apply to the transaction contemplated by this template, see .\nThis template does not contain specific drafting to address considerations relating to AI. For more information on issues to consider and some possible drafting solutions (provided by the Society for Computers and Law), see ,  and .\nThese standards terms assume that the only services being provided by the supplier are limited to those services set out in , namely maintenance and support, training, consultancy and disaster recovery / business continuity. In particular, it is assumed that the end system will be hosted and operated locally in the UK by the customer after being provided “Ready for Service” by the supplier. If the supplier is providing additional services, for example software as a service, or system hosting, then further service terms should be considered. For more information, see .\n  \nLegal issues\n \n \nIntellectual property rights\n \nSoftware is protected by intellectual property rights (IPRs), namely copyright, and, in some cases, patents as well (see ). This means that IPR issues must potentially be considered for three kinds of software in a systems integration agreement:\n \nPre-existing software used without modification.\nPre-existing software which is to be modified.\nNew software which is to be developed for the customer.\n \nLicence of IPRs\n \nEach party should carry out due diligence before entering into the agreement. They should find out what the IPR position is, and in particular, what licences are necessary for the project to go ahead and the effect of the existing contractual terms under the local law applicable to where the services are to be provided. The supplier should also seek to establish what it needs to provide the services, particularly in terms of licences from the customer, third-party licences and its own software.\n \nIn order to use pre-existing software, the customer needs a licence from the owner of the rights in the software (or from someone who has been granted rights to sub-license the software by the owner). Copyright is infringed by a number of acts, including the unauthorised copying of the copyright work. Since the mere act of loading software into a computer involves copying it onto its memory, a licence is required even for the most basic use of a computer program. If there is a patent, the use of software that is covered by any valid claim of that patent will also be patent infringement unless it is made under a licence. The precise scope of the licence is, however, a matter for negotiation between the parties (see ).\n \nMaking a derivative work can also be an infringement of copyright and, if it comes within a claim of the patent, patent infringement. Standard software licences almost always exclude, to the extent legally possible, the right to modify the software. While UK law does give a right to  software in order to obtain information that is needed to make that program operate with another independent program, that only relates to copyright. In any event it would be unwise to rely on that right as it is limited and untested in the courts (see ). To avoid liability for infringement, therefore, the supplier must get the rights-owner’s permission for pre-existing software to be modified for use in the customer’s system.\n \nOwnership of IPRs\n \nThe issue of ownership of the rights in any newly developed software is usually difficult to resolve. Unless specified to the contrary in the agreement, the default statutory position is that the supplier will own these. The customer often takes the position that, having paid for the software to be developed, it wants to own the rights in it. However, software is very rarely written from scratch; it is usually constructed using existing modules which the software developer has developed in previous projects and which it will want to use again for other customers. This means that the supplier will not usually agree to transfer ownership of all rights.\n \nThere are a number of approaches to giving each party what it needs:\n \nIf the customer’s main concern is that it does not want software that it has paid for to be sold to a competitor, the supplier could offer an exclusive licence to use the program as a whole, but only a non-exclusive licence to use the standard modules embedded in the program. If the supplier then wanted to re-use all or a significant part of the program at a later date, it could offer the customer a reduction in the original price or a payment for each further copy sold in return for an agreement to allow the program to be resold.\nIf the customer wants to be able to maintain the software itself, it could be given a copy of the source code and a licence which covers maintenance.\nIn the unusual case where the customer wants to commercially exploit the software itself, it could be given wide rights to sub-license. The customer should seek to have these rights free from restrictions, although the supplier should seek to exert some control over such sub-licensing, which could otherwise damage its business.\nSee .\n \nIPR Indemnity\n \nIt would be impractical for the customer to verify the supplier’s claims of ownership of the software and of the right to license its use. Accordingly, the customer will want to ensure that it is contractually protected if the supplier is not, in fact, so entitled. This protection is necessary in case the IPRs in all or part of the software actually belong to someone else, and the licensor has not given the supplier the right to grant sub-licences. This may happen even where the software was written by the supplier, for example, in cases where it has transferred the IPRs in the software to a previous customer. It can also be relevant if, in writing the software, an employee of the supplier copied code from a pre-existing program belonging to a third party. In those situations, use of the software by the customer would constitute a breach of the third-party IPRs in the software and would expose the customer to the risk of an infringement action.\n \nIt is therefore usual for the supplier to provide some protection for the customer against claims that the software infringes any third-party IPRs, commonly in the form of a contractual indemnity (see ). This may be subject to a capped amount and should exclude infringement caused by the customer’s own activities (see ). The customer will often contend that the supplier should remain liable for infringements arising from use of the software or hardware it supplies in conjunction with other software or hardware which it knew was required to implement and use the system, for example, the operating system or standard database software.\n \nFor more information, see .\n \nWarranties\n \nThere is uncertainty as to whether a contract for the provision of bespoke software is legally classified as a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for the provision of services, although the tax authorities have their own tests. In the case of systems integration agreements, the classification may depend on the ratio of the value of goods (standard software) to services (modifications, bespoke software and integration) in the contract. The draftsperson needs to keep in mind the provisions of legislation and case law relating to both types of contract, particularly in the area of  and limitation of liability.\n \nSystems integration agreements typically include warranties relating to the supplier’s rights to license the software (see above). The customer will usually seek warranties as to the performance of the system, so as to ensure that there are legal remedies available to it if there are serious problems with the system’s performance. The supplier should not in general offer such warranties, and, if they are required as part of the negotiated agreement, they should be tied strictly to demonstrable performance standards, which should be contained in an agreed technical specification (see ). This is not necessarily bad for the customer, as it results in standards of performance that can readily be measured, and failure to meet those standards will be much easier to prove in a dispute.\n \nFor more information, see .\n \nLimitation of liability\n \nSee .\n \nReliance and entire agreement clause\n \nThe customer may seek to recite specifically in the agreement its reliance on representations made in the supplier’s response to the customer’s invitation to tender. Suppliers should always resist a general recital of reliance and the most they will usually agree to is having the specific representations the customer says it relied on incorporated into the contract. If they are not so incorporated, the aim of the entire agreement clause is to exclude representations not in this agreement, so they cannot be relied on in a later dispute.\n \nFor more information, see  and .\n \nWEEE Regulations and product standards and labelling\n \nProducers (manufacturers, resellers, sellers and importers) of new electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) should be aware that, under the  they are obliged to finance the collection, treatment recovery and environmentally sound disposal of waste EEE (WEEE) by joining an approved producer compliance scheme (PCS). Larger distributors (retailers) also have take-back requirements to collect very small WEEE in their retail areas to return to the producers. Producers must also mark all new EEE in such a manner that they can be easily identified as its producer, and that the equipment can be readily identified as having been put on the market. Producers must also mark all new EEE with a crossed-out wheelie bin symbol (indicating it should not be disposed of as part of unsorted municipal waste).\n \nFor more information, see .\n \nIn addition, from 1 January 2021, UK conformity assessments in respect of CE markings will no longer be valid in the EU and UK businesses selling into the EU will need to obtain new EU-issued certificates or transfer existing UK certificates to an EU-based assessor. The UK will introduce a UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark for products that require third party assessment of conformity within the UK. The CE and UKCA markings will both be valid in the UK for a currently undefined period of time, after which only the UKCA mark will be accepted on UK products. After the end of the , UK manufacturers exporting products to the EU will need to appoint an importer and EU products destined for the UK market will require a UK importer. For more information, see .\n \nBribery Act 2010\n \nThe  (BA 2010) came into force on 1 July 2011. It replaces the existing criminal offences of bribery, and also introduces new offences. It sets out:\n \nThe offence of bribing another person (, BA 2010).\nThe offences relating to being bribed (, BA 2010).\nThe offence of bribing a foreign public official (, BA 2010).\nThe offence of failure of commercial organisations to prevent bribery (, BA 2010).\nOf particular concern is the section 7 corporate offence of failure to prevent bribery by an associated person. A commercial organisation (including a company or partnership) will be guilty of an offence if a person associated with it bribes another person intending to obtain or retain business for the commercial organisation, or to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for the commercial organisation (section 7, BA 2010).\n \nUnder the BA 2010, a person (A) is associated with a relevant commercial organisation (C) if A performs services for or on behalf of C (, BA 2010). Although the BA 2010 specifically states that A may be C’s employee, subsidiary or agent, it does not matter in what capacity A performs services for or on behalf of C. Whether or not A is a person who performs services for or on behalf of C is to be determined by reference to all the relevant circumstances, and not merely by reference to the nature of the relationship between A and C.\n \nUnder this definition, a supplier of services will be an associated person to its customer (the commercial organisation). As it is a customer who is at risk of committing the section 7 offence, a supplier should therefore be prepared for its customer raising the issue as part of its selection process and in negotiations:\n \nA customer may ask questions about the supplier and its own anti-bribery policies as part of a due diligence exercise.\nA customer may require comfort in the form of anti-bribery clauses in its agreement with the supplier. For an example, see . Practitioners acting for suppliers should review these clauses, as they reflect, broadly, typical obligations required by a customer.\nSuppliers should consider creating and implementing their own anti-bribery and corruption policies (for information, see ). By implementing their own policies and procedures, a supplier can avoid the cost implications and practical difficulties in having to comply with numerous (and potentially significantly different) anti-bribery policies of all its customers. This approach will also provide comfort to a customer that it is dealing with a supplier that takes the BA 2010 seriously.\nThe supplier’s own policies and procedures should be annexed to their own standard form commercial agreements which fall into scope of the section 7 offence.\nIf amending a customer’s anti-bribery clauses to reduce their strength (for example, by making them warranties), a supplier should note that a well advised customer is very likely to reject this approach in negotiations, as it will rightly point out that it is the party who risks committing the criminal offence under section 7 of the BA 2010.\nWhere the arrangement includes a supply chain, so that the supplier is appointing subcontractors to perform services, a supplier will need to do appropriate anti-bribery due diligence on such subcontractors, and require the subcontractors to comply with any anti-bribery obligations imposed by a customer. For further information, see the discussion on supply chain issues in .\nFor information and all PLC materials on bribery, see .\n \nPayment mechanisms\n \nThe payment mechanism provisions are set out in clause 14 and schedule 4. For alternative payment mechanism provisions, see ,  and .\n \nFor more information on software-related agreements generally, see  and .\n \nConsequences for licensors and licensees in the light of UsedSoft decision\n \nSee ,  and .\n \nCompetition issues\n \nUnder UK competition law, a party’s refusal to license materials protected by IPRs to third parties can in certain circumstances be challenged under Chapter II of the  (Competition Act), The Chapter II prohibition is based on Article 102 of  (TFEU), and prohibits abuses of dominance in a market which may have an effect on trade within the UK or any part of it.\n \nIn addition, Chapter I of the Competition Act, based on Article 101 of the TFEU, prohibits anti-competitive agreements between undertakings (that is, any natural or legal person carrying on economic activities, including companies, sole traders and trading divisions of public bodies), which have the object or effect of restricting competition within the UK and which affect trade within the UK or any part of it.\n \nEntering into an agreement that breaches UK competition law can result in:\n \nThe agreement (or particular sections of it) being null and void.\nThe parties being subject to investigation and enforcement proceedings by UK competition authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nPotential exposure to large fines and private actions for damages.\nThe EU competition rules (Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU) will continue to apply, at the end of the , to agreements or conduct of UK companies that have an effect within the EU, see .\n \nAt the EU level, an agreement that is caught by Article 101(1) TFEU may nevertheless escape prohibition (and therefore voidness) under Article 101(3) TFEU if it is subject to either an individual or block exemption. Block exemptions provide a safe harbour for the relevant agreement, meaning that satisfaction of the block exemption criteria will provide assurance that the agreement will not infringe competition law. Disapplication or non-satisfaction of a block exemption does not necessarily mean that an agreement will breach competition law, however it will mean the safe harbour does not apply and an individual assessment is required. Agreements that include so-called ‘hardcore restrictions’ set out in the block exemptions are likely to cause competition concern. For more information, see .\n \nIn the UK,  apply to agreements which are covered by an EU Commission individual or block exemption under Article 101(3) of the TFEU, or would be covered by an EU Commission block exemption if the agreement had an appreciable effect on trade between EU member states. Agreements covered by parallel exemptions are automatically exempt from the Chapter I prohibition.\n \nIn the licensing context,  on the application of Article 101(3) of the TFEU to categories of technology transfer agreements (the technology transfer block exemption regulation (TTBER)) is particularly relevant.\n \nUnder the terms of the TTBER,\n \nHardcore restrictions (Article 4) – restrictions on onward sales price, and territories. It is a hardcore restriction disapplying the block exemption for an agreement to restrict the ability of a licensee to determine prices when onward selling to third parties, and to allocate markets unless it forms part of a reserved exclusive territory. It is also a hardcore restriction to restrict the exploitation of the licencee’s own technology unless it is indispensable to prevent disclosure of licensed IP (Article 4). A hardcore restriction disapplies the block exemption and would require individual assessment for any competition concern.\nExcluded restrictions (Article 5) - Grant-back of rights. It is an excluded restriction, voiding the relevant clause but not the whole agreement, to include any direct or indirect obligation to grant-back rights to improvements made by the licensee, and to include any no-challenge clause in relation to the IP.\nAfter the end of the transition period, the EU block exemptions were adopted into UK law as “retained exemptions”, with their same expiry date, but domesticated to remove EU references. As a result, agreements that currently enjoy a safe harbour under one of these parallel block exemptions will continue to do so post-transition period.\n \nCompanies entering into new agreements after December 2020 will also be able to benefit from the retained exemptions, provided they meet the relevant criteria. However, companies should be aware that UK courts and authorities may be able to divert from previous EU interpretation of the block exemptions, most likely where there are material differences in UK and EU legislation or markets, even if this is initially unlikely.\n \nThe UK has also made adjustments to each of the retained exemptions as they come up for renewal. The UK has already published a new Vertical Agreements Block Exemption Order, Research and Development Block Exemption Order and Specialisation Agreements Block Exemption Order, and Motor Vehicles Agreements Block Exemption Order, together with updated guidelines (see ,  and . In each case the UK broadly adopted the same provisions as the EU block exemption, but made minor revisions to clarify or expand the scope in certain areas.\n \nThe EU Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation expires on 30 April 2026. The CMA has recommended repacing it with a new Technology Transfer Block Exemption Order, see .\n \nFor more information, see the following Practice notes:\n \n.\n.\n.\n\n\n\n \nDigital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024\nThe parties should consider whether they are affected by the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA) which received Royal Assent on 24 May 2024. The DMCCA provides a new digital markets regime and reforms competition law and consumer law. Apart from provisions relating to the foreign acquisition of newspapers and energy network mergers (which are already in force) the DMCCA will be brought into force by statutory instrument. The digital markets and competition aspects apply from 1 January 2025.\n \nFor more information  and .\n \nSupply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking\n \nThe  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement each financial year. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.\n \nThe supplier should note that the customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the supplier will comply with the customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the supplier may require the customer to comply with the supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.\n \nFor further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see  .\n \nData protection\n \nWhere  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at  or, alternatively, as part of a data protection schedule to be annexed to this agreement.\n \nThe clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.\n \nFor some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:\n \n.\n.\nEach set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.\n \nFor a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .\n \nCybersecurity\n \nCybersecurity obligations are becoming more prominent in IT agreements, including as statutory controls and obligations in relation to network and information system, and data security are increasing, see:\n \n.\n.\n.\nFor more information on conducting cybersecurity risk assessments, see  and for more information about managing cyber risk in an organisation’s supply chain, see .\n \n \nEU considerations\nThis standard document is drafted on the assumption that the supplier and the customer are limited companies incorporated in the UK and the services are intended for use in the UK. Where the services are used within the EU, it may also be necessary to consider compliance with any minimum cybersecurity requirements set out in current and planned EU regulations (in particular, Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (NIS 2) and Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector (DORA). For more information, see .\n \nNetwork and Information Systems Regulations 2018\nThe predominant cybersecurity legislation to consider is the  (NIS Regulations) which came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the  (also known as the Network and Information Security or NIS Directive). They have potential impact on:\n \nany operator of essential services (OES) in businesses that rely on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure; and\nrelevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).\nAlthough the NIS Regulations do not set out prescriptive cybersecurity requirements, compliance with their terms requires appropriate and proportionate security measures to be implemented. This will depend on the cybersecurity risk which is identified. For more information, see .\n \nLike the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.\n \nFor a definition of an OES see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .\n \nOESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OES).\n \nIf the customer is an OES or a RDSP, the supplier’s system might be implicated in the customer’s obligations under the NIS Regulations. During systems integration work the customer and supplier systems are likely to interface with each other, particularly during the acceptance testing phase. Each party is likely to carry out a range of tests and the supplier is likely to provide a variety of online development tools for this purpose. Test data is likely to include actual personal data at some point and this is when a security breach may have significant compliance consequences for OESs and RDSPs under the NIS Regulations, as well as under any data protection legislation. The customer will want to ensure that the supplier cooperates in the event of a security incident.\n \nThe customer may ask for a warranty in relation to the supplier’s network security levels, and to ensure the supplier cooperates with any of the customer’s regulatory obligations. An example of the type of clause the customer might ask for is set out in clause 22 of . It may be reasonable to agree to such provisions, and in fact the supplier may have developed comprehensive processes and policies to support the services it provides. However, the supplier should in return ask for a warranty or some form of approval that the information the supplier provides is sufficient for the customer to meet its obligations under the NIS Regulations.\n \nThe National Cyber Security Centre has published  which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances. See also .\n \nThere may also be specific guidance issued by the regulator for the specific OES sector or, for RDSPs, the ICO.\n \nProduct Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022\nThe  (PSTIA 2022) is framework legislation only, but implementing regulations passed during 2023 bring Part 1 of the PSTIA 2022 fully into force from 29 April 2024. Obligations for in scope products include periodic security updates, password administration and vulnerability management (see  and ).\n \nWhile in-scope products are generally limited to consumer products which can connect to the internet or other networks, and can transmit and receive digital data, with examples including smartphones, smart TVs, smart speakers, connected baby monitors and connected alarm systems, the PSTIA 2022 is also potentially relevant to software embedded in such devices, where those devices are being used for business purposes (but where identical products have also been marketed to consumers).\n \nAt the EU level, similar provisions apply to in-scope products with a digital element under the Cyber Resilience Act (see ).\n \nThe parties will need to consider whether the obligations contained in this agreement are compatible with (and do not override) any mandatory obligations that are imposed on manufacturers, importers and distributors under this legislation.\n  \nNegotiating and drafting issues\n \n \nBargaining power of parties\n \nThere are often significant differences in size and bargaining power between parties to system integration agreements. There are a few very large suppliers of IT services who have considerable experience in most of the usual types of system integration projects. They tend to have standard terms which are favourable to them and refuse to make any significant changes except for very large customers, such as national governments. On the other hand, there are small specialised supplier firms who have to deal with customers who are much more powerful than them. For example, such firms with expertise in very sophisticated financial software may be negotiating with large and powerful banks and financial institutions. In practice, it is not in the long-term interest of the more powerful party to insist on a one-sided contract, as this tends to lead to disputes. Another risk of this approach is that, where the contract is obviously unfair, the courts are more likely to apply  and other legal principles in favour of the weaker party.\n \nEscrow agreement\n \nThe customer may ask for a source code escrow arrangement, particularly when software has been specially developed or modified. This is a means of ensuring that the customer will be able to continue to support the software, either itself or through a third-party maintainer, if the supplier fails to do so adequately or at all. While this situation may arise due to insolvency, the customer may insist that this is not the only trigger for release of the escrowed code, as suppliers who are in financial trouble tend to provide inadequate maintenance long before they become officially insolvent.\n \nIt is normal in systems integrations where there has been software development or modification for the supplier to agree to an escrow agreement. However, the supplier should ensure that the terms of the agreement:\n \nRestrict access to the source code to circumstances where it is truly unwilling or unable to provide support.\nDo not trigger access where there is merely a dispute over the cost of maintenance.\nWhere software has been specially developed or modified, the customer will probably seek to include, in the escrow deposit, supporting documentation that will help a new programmer to understand how the software operates. Where the supplier continues to provide maintenance, updates or new versions of the software, the customer is likely to request that the source code for any changes is promptly deposited with the escrow agent.\n \nFor more information, see  and .\n \nIf acting for the customer, see also  relating to .\n \nStructure and content of agreement\n \nThe standard document covers all types of software supply, including:\n \nStandard software owned by the supplier or third parties which is to be used without modifications.\nStandard software to be modified for use by the customer.\nSoftware specially developed for the customer.\nModifications to the standard document may be required, depending on what the supplier is providing.\n \nFor the supplier who is also going to provide maintenance of all or part of the system, a simple set of maintenance provisions is to be found in . If these provisions suffice, then  and  should be deleted. Where more complicated terms are required (for example, where the software is critical to the customer’s business and more detailed response time requirements are needed), it may be advisable to put the maintenance provisions in a separate, but annexed, contract. If the supplier is not going to provide such services under the agreement, then:\n \nRemove .\nDelete the definitions of , , , ,  and .\nAmend  accordingly.\nAttach the maintenance and support agreement as .\nIn addition, the task of preparing the agreement is made simpler if all the variables are put into schedules or appendices so that the main text of the agreement can used for each customer without having to be amended. In addition to the contractual terms and conditions, there will normally be:\n \nA functional specification (defined as Business Requirements Specification), setting out what the software is to do and the business requirements it must fulfil.\nAn acceptance testing procedure.\nA project implementation plan, including a timetable.\nIn addition, there may be one or more of the following:\n \nA technical specification of the software.\nA change control procedure (if this is not dealt with in the body of the agreement).\nA dispute resolution procedure or arbitration procedure, if this is not dealt with in the body of the agreement.\nA specification of the documentation to be provided.\nA specification of additional services (such as training, business continuity and disaster recovery) that are to be provided.\nA payments schedule.\nA contract for ongoing maintenance of all or part of the software, although (as in the standard document) if the arrangement is simple, this may also be dealt with in the agreement itself.\nOne or more source code escrow agreements.\nA copy of the customer’s invitation to tender and the supplier’s proposal. These two documents are not referred to in the standard document as the supplier should not offer to include them, but the customer may insist that they should form part of the agreement (see ). If they are to be included they should be added as an annex, and it is vital to ensure that they are properly incorporated by reference into the agreement. The parties must also ensure that any potential conflict between the provisions of these documents is dealt with by specifying an order of precedence between them. Their place in that order will have to be negotiated. The supplier should resist having its proposal given a higher ranking than the express terms of the agreement, as this could lead to it being held contractually to statements made at an early stage, relying solely on the customer’s tender documents.\n \nSchedules and annexes\n \nSystem integration agreements typically have several schedules, which will contain details of matters and items that are to be provided under the agreement, and anything else that is to be included. The contract is more manageable if these details are in separate schedules at the end of the agreement rather than being set out in the body of the agreement, but the agreement must make it clear that these are contractual terms and conditions. It should also provide for possible conflicts between these documents (see Drafting note, Structure and content of agreement).\n \nWhere there are related agreements, for example, the software licence and maintenance agreement, they should be annexed to the main agreement. Annexation means that the agreements will be interpreted as related agreements. It also has the practical benefit of keeping all the agreements readily to hand in one place. The customer may assert that it is relying on representations made by the supplier in the response to the invitation to tender, in which case it will want to have these documents annexed to the main agreement. The supplier should strongly resist this, and may offer instead to incorporate in the agreement those specific representations the customer wants to rely on (see  and ).\n \nDrafting for environmental sustainability\n \nThe  (TCLP) brings together legal professionals to create model climate clauses that lawyers, businesses and governments can use in commercial contracts and transactions to help fight climate change and support the move towards achieving net zero. TCLP is independent of any professional body or practice and is politically neutral. It has published  which may be integrated into this agreement to allow the parties to adjust their obligations so as to become “lower carbon”, and/or to require their counterparty to do the same.\n \nOther model clauses are freely available for incorporation into law firm precedents and commercial agreements.","style":"Normal","level":null,"section_id":"d57f60f9-4de4-4c38-958b-5a876ada1f48","list":null,"table":{"table_id":"tbl_1","row":0,"col":0},"anchor":null,"metadata":null,"heading":{"text":"Body (no heading)","source":"none","fallback_label":"Body (no heading)"},"runs":[{"text":"About this document","formats":["bold"]},{"text":" ","formats":[]},{"text":"Systems integration agreements are contracts for the acquisition, development and integration of the hardware and software necessary to produce (in conjunction with the customer’s business data) an entire computer system.","formats":[]},{"text":" ","formats":[]},{"text":"There are several types of systems integration agreement:","formats":[]},{"text":" ","formats":[]},{"text":" without any software development.","formats":[]},{"text":"Turnkey with some software development.","formats":[]},{"text":"An agreement for the assembly of components that have been purchased separately by the customer.","formats":[]},{"text":"An agreement for the integration of components that have been purchased separately by the customer, including some software modification or development.","formats":[]},{"text":"An agreement for the integration of new components with the customer’s existing system, which usually involves some software modification or development.","formats":[]},{"text":"Within these types, individual agreements will vary widely depending on the system, the customer’s business and the use to which the system is put.

If you need more comprehensive provisions, attach appropriate stand-alone pro forma agreements. Any obligation to provide disaster recovery and business continuity services (see ) typically arises where the contract services are ongoing in nature, such as maintenance and support. If greater certainty is required regarding these terms, consider attaching a pro forma agreement as an appendix to this agreement, using a similar approach to that adopted for maintenance and support.\n \nIt is good drafting practice to place all the supplier’s principal obligations together in the agreement, as this makes it easier to check that everything has been addressed to the supplier’s satisfaction.\n \nThe supplier should try to tie its obligations to modify and develop software (,  and ) to the requirements of the technical specification, which will normally include more precise definitions of the functions such software is to perform (and of any performance criteria) than the business requirements’ specification will contain.\n \nThe obligations to provide the system and associated services are expressed simply as acts (see  and ), completion of which it should be simple to demonstrate. The supplier should resist having these obligations tied to satisfactory outcomes of these acts described in general terms, which would be the preferred drafting from the customer’s point of view. If the customer insists on some reference to outcomes, the supplier should agree to no more than tying the acts to the specific provisions of the specifications, with some allowance for error. For example, a supplier would want to agree an acceptable error rate for the conversion of the customer’s data (as no conversion process can be guaranteed to be 100% accurate), perhaps combined with a provision for correcting mistakes that are found during a specified period.\n \nWhile the ideal situation for the supplier would seem to be to have no obligations as to the standard of work carried out, in practice the courts are likely to view the absence of any such obligation as unreasonable. The standards set out in clause 8.1 do go somewhat further than the legally implied obligation of reasonable skill and expertise, but should be achievable by any competent supplier. Note that the outcome is expressed as meeting the requirements of the technical specification, rather than the business requirements specification (see  and  above).\n \nIt is rare for a brand new system to be installed. The customer will almost always have an existing system which the supplier is going to either upgrade or replace. In either event, the supplier will need to have both physical and remote access to the existing system (hardware and software) and to the customer’s data. This need for access () has to be balanced against the customer’s need to go on running its business while the new system is being developed. The customer must have an obligation to co-operate in carrying out the work, in particular to allow the supplier’s staff reasonable access to information and the site, and to provide necessary supplies for the supplier’s personnel working on the customer’s site. The customer may want more control over rights of access than this clause gives, but the supplier must be careful not to end up in a situation where the project cannot be completed on time because access is not provided, or where it ends up paying its personnel overtime from its own pocket because access is only given outside normal working hours (unless this expense has been factored into the agreed price at the beginning) (). The customer may also require that the supplier accept an obligation of responsible conduct to go with the right of access ().","style":"Normal","level":null,"section_id":"9c9d5d5c-d318-4a4f-b2fa-d207b6bf868b","list":null,"table":{"table_id":"tbl_32","row":0,"col":0},"anchor":null,"metadata":null,"heading":{"text":"Body (no heading)","source":"none","fallback_label":"Body (no heading)"},"runs":[{"text":"Services","formats":["bold"]},{"text":" ","formats":[]},{"text":"There is provision in Schedule 3 for details of training and disaster recovery and business continuity services (see ","formats":[]},{"text":").
