# Acting for Customer #

* Ensure that agreeing to any change in scope, specification or anything which could incur more charges must require the signature of an authorised representative of the Customer.  Consider creating a definition for "Customer's Authorised Representative" if it doesn't exist already.

* Ask client how much formality they need.  Is it enough to say that these changes must be agreed in writing?  Or should all changes be signed off by a specific person?
