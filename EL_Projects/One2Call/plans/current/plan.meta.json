      "description": "**DECISIONS LOG \u2014 For Client Advice Note**\n\nThis task captures key decisions made during the contract review and consolidation project. These should be communicated to the client in the final advice note.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURAL DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION S1: Document Architecture (Option B)**\n\n**Decision:** Adopt modular MSA structure with detachable Schedules and Annexes.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\nMSA (HJ7)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cover / Order Form (commercial details, service selection, term/notice overrides)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 1: Terms and Conditions (core legal terms)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 2: Data Protection (existing)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 3: Installation & Provisioning Services (NEW \u2014 common framework)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3A: Managed IT Services\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3B: Cyber Security Services\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3C: Cloud Management\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3D: Connectivity (Ethernet \u2014 36m/60d defaults)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3E: Telecoms (Horizon/VoIP \u2014 24m/60d defaults)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Annex 3F: Hardware Provision & Maintenance\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 4: Security Schedule (optional \u2014 for cyber services)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Schedule 5: Maintenance Schedule (from HJ1)\n```\n\n**Hierarchy:** Order Form (highest) \u2192 Schedule 1 \u2192 Schedule 3 + Annexes \u2192 Other Schedules\n\n**Rationale:** Provides flexibility to assemble contract per engagement while maintaining consistent core terms. Avoids repetition across service-specific documents.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION S2: Separate Mobile from Horizon**\n\n**Decision:** Create separate Annex for Mobile services (not combined with Horizon VoIP in Annex 3E).\n\n**Rationale:** Mobile terms have fundamentally different structure (25 clauses vs 11) and cover different subject matter:\n- Mobile: SIM cards, handsets, porting, roaming, network coverage, MultiNet\n- Horizon: VoIP, SBC, IP addresses, emergency services warning\n\n**Impact:** May need Annex 3E-VoIP and Annex 3E-Mobile, or renumber to 3E and 3G.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION S3: Schedule 3 Common Framework**\n\n**Decision:** Extract common installation/provisioning provisions from Ethernet and Horizon terms into Schedule 3 (common framework), with service-specific details in Annexes.\n\n**Common provisions identified:**\n1. Site surveys\n2. Site preparation & amendments\n3. Installation obligations\n4. Commissioning & testing\n5. Acceptance testing (5 Working Days)\n6. Service demarcation point (framework)\n7. Equipment ownership & return\n8. Customer-supplied equipment\n9. Reservation of rights\n10. Appointment scheduling\n\n**Rationale:** Avoids repetition; ensures consistency across installed services.\n\n---\n\n## MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION M1: Default Response Times**\n\n**Decision:** Set defaults in Schedule 5:\n- Response Time (>50% failure): 4 hours\n- Response Time (other faults): 8 hours\n- Business Hours: 8am-6pm Mon-Fri\n\n**Exception:** Phone systems default to 9 hours (not 8) via conditional clause in Schedule 5 cl 7.3(b).\n\n**Rationale:** Provides clean universal default with service-specific carve-out. Derived from Access Control/CCTV (8h) and Phone (9h) old terms.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M2: Service Credits**\n\n**Decision:** Offer menu of service credit options in Order Form (not defaults in Schedule 5):\n- \u00a350 per breach (fixed)\n- 5% of monthly fee per breach\n- 10% of monthly fee per breach\n- Custom amount\n\n**Rationale:** Service credits vary significantly by customer and service value. Better to select per Order than impose universal default.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M3: Equipment-Specific Exclusions**\n\n**Decision:** Use conditional clause in Schedule 5 (not separate Annexes) for equipment-specific exclusions.\n\n**Example clause:** \"If the Maintained Equipment includes telephone systems, the Maintenance Services shall not cover 2-wire devices unless expressly stated in the Order.\"\n\n**Rationale:** Only one equipment-specific exclusion identified (2-wire devices for phones). Doesn't justify separate Annexes.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M4: Alterations to Equipment**\n\n**Decision:** Keep HJ1's strict approach requiring prior written approval for alterations.\n\n**Rationale:** HJ1 approach is stricter than old terms (which allowed Customer alterations). Stricter approach protects Supplier's maintenance obligations.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M5: Equipment Destruction/Theft**\n\n**Decision:** Add softer termination right (30 days' notice) rather than old terms' approach (Customer remains liable).\n\n**New clause:** \"If the Maintained Equipment is destroyed, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, either party may terminate this Schedule on 30 days' written notice, and the Customer shall pay the Standard Maintenance Fees up to the date of termination.\"\n\n**Client comment required:** \"This clause departs from your old maintenance terms, which stated that theft/destruction of equipment would not affect the Customer's payment obligations. We have softened this to allow either party to terminate on 30 days' notice, with fees payable up to termination.\"\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M6: Early Termination**\n\n**Decision:** Add early termination clause to Schedule 5 \u2014 remaining fees due if Customer terminates before end of term.\n\n**New clause:** \"If the Customer terminates this Schedule before the end of the Service Initial Period or any Service Renewal Period (other than in accordance with clause 10.1 or for Supplier breach), the Customer shall pay to the Supplier all Standard Maintenance Fees that would have been payable for the remainder of that period.\"\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M7: Scope Changes**\n\n**Decision:** Add scope change clause to Schedule 5 \u2014 Supplier may adjust fees if maintained equipment changes materially.\n\n**New clause:** \"If the scope of the Maintained Equipment changes materially from that specified in the Order (including any increase in the number of users, devices, or software licences), the Supplier may, on reasonable written notice, adjust the Standard Maintenance Fees to reflect the changed scope.\"\n\n---\n\n## MSA CORE DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION C1: Price Increases \u2014 No Change Needed**\n\n**Decision:** MSA cl 11.7 already covers price increases adequately.\n\n**Existing provision:**\n- Pass-through of supplier increases: any time, 30 days notice\n- General inflationary increases: once per 12 months\n- Customer termination right: if single increase >10%, Customer can terminate within 14 days\n\n**Rationale:** Better than old maintenance terms which had no termination right.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION C2: Interest on Late Payment \u2014 No Change Needed**\n\n**Decision:** MSA cl 14.14 already covers interest (8% above BoE base rate).\n\n**Rationale:** Actually higher than old terms (which had 4% in some documents, 5% in others).\n\n---\n\n**DECISION C3: Liability Cap \u2014 No Change Needed**\n\n**Decision:** MSA cl 19.4 already has \u00a3100,000 liability cap per client instruction.\n\n**Rationale:** Client has already made commercial decision on cap level.\n\n---\n\n## ANNEX 3E (HORIZON/VoIP) DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION V1: Emergency Services Warning Placement**\n\n**Decision:** Place 999/112 warning prominently at START of Annex 3E (not in Order Form).\n\n**Rationale:** Regulatory compliance requirement (Ofcom). Prominent placement in Annex ensures customers are clearly informed when they select VoIP services.\n\n**Client comment required:** \"This warning is a regulatory compliance requirement for VoIP services. Ofcom requires providers to inform customers about the limitations of VoIP emergency calling. Failure to provide adequate warning could expose One2Call to regulatory action and liability claims.\"\n\n---\n\n**DECISION V2: Equipment Maintenance via Order Form**\n\n**Decision:** Equipment Maintenance indicated in Order Form. If selected, Schedule 5 (Maintenance Schedule) applies to the Maintained Equipment specified.\n\n**Rationale:** Clean separation \u2014 Order Form selects services; Schedule 5 contains maintenance terms.\n\n---\n\n## RETIREMENT DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION R1: Retire Standalone Sale of Goods Terms**\n\n**Decision:** Retire the standalone \"Terms & Conditions for the Sale of Goods\" document.\n\n**Rationale:** The MSA (HJ7) already contains comprehensive goods provisions at clauses 4-8:\n\u2022 Cl 4: Goods Specification\n\u2022 Cl 5: Delivery (notes, location, late/short delivery, instalments)\n\u2022 Cl 6: Acceptance (48-hour deemed acceptance, 5-day defect notification)\n\u2022 Cl 7: Quality/Warranty (description conformity, repair/replace/refund, UCTA exclusions)\n\u2022 Cl 8: Title and Risk (risk on delivery, title on payment, retention provisions)\n\n**Impact:** For pure product sales with no ongoing services, One2Call should use the MSA with an Order that specifies Goods only.\n\n**Old Document Path:** `C:\\Users\\DavidSant\\effi-contract-review\\EL_Projects\\One2Call\\old_terms\\One2Call-Terms-and-Conditions-for-the-Sale-of-Goods\\`\n\n---\n\n**DECISION R2: Retire Business Communications General Terms**\n\n**Decision:** The Business Communications General Terms will be replaced by the enhanced MSA (HJ7).\n\n**Rationale:** Business Communications is the current \"master\" document. The MSA will assume this role with improved provisions and modular structure.\n\n**Old Document Path:** `C:\\Users\\DavidSant\\effi-contract-review\\EL_Projects\\One2Call\\old_terms\\One2Call-Business-Communications-General-Terms-and-Conditions.pdf\\`\n\n---\n\n## BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS GAP DECISIONS\n\nThe following gaps were identified by comparing the Business Communications General Terms against the MSA. Decisions made on where each provision should be placed in the new document structure.\n\n**DECISION B1: No-Resale Provision**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 2.1-2.2 restricts resale and bandwidth-sharing.\n**Decision:** Add to MSA cl 12 (general) + leased-line context in Annex 3E.\n**Rationale:** General restriction belongs in MSA core; leased-line-specific language in Annex where it's most relevant.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B2-B6: Telephone Numbers & Services (Entire Clause 4)**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 4 covers all telephone number and service provisions:\n- Cl 4.1-4.4: Telephone number allocation and management\n- Cl 4.5: Number ownership (numbers are licensed, not owned)\n- Cl 4.6: Number reallocation on reasonable notice\n- Cl 4.7: Number porting obligations and charges\n- Cl 4.8-4.9: Call routing changes and CLI disclosure\n- Cl 4.10-4.12: Inbound number provisions\n\n**Decision:** Keep ALL of Business Comms cl 4 in Annex 3E (Telecoms).\n**Rationale:** These are telecoms-specific provisions that should remain together in the telecoms annex. Keeping cl 4 intact maintains coherence and avoids fragmentation across multiple documents.\n\n**Note:** Annex 3D (Connectivity) may need a cross-reference to Annex 3E for any geographic numbers associated with connectivity services, but the substantive provisions remain in 3E.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B7: Credit Check Consent**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 5.6 includes consent to credit checks.\n**Decision:** Add to MSA cl 14 (Charges).\n**Rationale:** Credit checking is a general commercial term that applies across all services, not service-specific.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B8: Call Monitoring Disclosure**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 6 requires Customer to disclose call monitoring to its staff.\n**Decision:** Add to MSA cl 18 (Data Protection).\n**Rationale:** This is a data protection/RIPA compliance matter, not service-specific. Fits with existing DP clause.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B9: No Third-Party Repairs**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 7.1 requires all repairs through Supplier.\n**Decision:** Add to Schedule 3 (common framework).\n**Rationale:** This is a general equipment/service protection provision that applies across all installed services, not specific to any one Annex.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B10: Early Termination Formula**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 11.2 contains specific early termination payment formula (remaining contract value \u00d7 discount percentage).\n**Decision:** Add to each relevant Annex separately (3D, 3E).\n**Rationale:** Different services have different contract periods and commercial structures. Formula may vary by Annex.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B11: Subsidy/Equipment Clawback**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 11.4 requires clawback of subsidies on equipment if Customer terminates early.\n**Decision:** Add to each relevant Annex separately (3D, 3E).\n**Rationale:** Subsidy arrangements are service-specific (e.g., handset subsidies for mobile, router subsidies for connectivity).\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B12: Marketing Consent**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 14 provides marketing consent and right to use Customer name as reference.\n**Decision:** Add to MSA cl 24 (General).\n**Rationale:** This is a general commercial term that applies across the customer relationship, not service-specific.\n\n---\n\n*Additional decisions to be added as they are made during this project.*",
