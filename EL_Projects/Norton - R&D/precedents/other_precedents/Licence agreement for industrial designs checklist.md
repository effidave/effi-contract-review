Licence agreement for industrial designs: checklist
by Catherine Bingham, Dentons, and Hilary Newiss, formerly of Denton Hall

Checklists | Law stated as at 18-Feb-2022 | United Kingdom

A checklist of the main issues to be considered when appointing a licensee of industrial designs and drafting a licence of industrial designs.
 

Points to consider when appointing a licensee of industrial designs and drafting a licence of industrial designs:
 
Drafting for Brexit
On 31 January 2020 (exit day), the UK left the EU and the UK-EU withdrawal agreement entered into force. Following the end of the UK-EU transition period at 11.00 pm UK time on 31 December 2020, retained EU law and the remaining withdrawal agreement provisions entered into force, and the future relationship agreements (including the UK-EU trade and co-operation agreement) started to apply on a provisional basis, entering into force at 11.00 pm (UK time) on 30 April 2021. This resource has been reviewed and reflects the position from the end of the transition period.
For general information on the withdrawal agreement, future relationship agreements, and the operation of UK law following the end of the transition period, see UK legal change post-transition and UK-EU agreements toolkit and Practical Law’s Brexit page.

Choosing a licensee
Why appoint a licensee? What are the gaps in the licensor's expertise or resources?
Draw up a shortlist of potential licensee companies for the particular territory based on factors such as:
strength and reputation in the local market;
extent of existing distribution network;
manufacturing capacity.
Do the resources of the licensee (who may, for example, need to make substantial up-front investment) dovetail with the resources of the licensor (who may, for example, need to provide training and know-how)? How large is the potential licensee? How financially viable is it? Does the licensee have too many other commitments?
Does the licensee have good relations with governmental organisations?
What is the licensee's track record in similar projects? What is the extent of its knowledge and experience in the relevant market?
Have well-constructed business plans been put together by both the licensor and the licensee?
How good is the relationship between the licensor and the licensee? Are they properly motivated to make the arrangements work?
 
Preliminary matters
Parties
•	Should the licensee's parent company or other shareholders give a guarantee? Will the licensor's parent company or other shareholders be asked to give a guarantee? Do any of them need to be made a party to the licence to ensure compliance with a non-compete clause? Do any other companies within the licensee's group need the benefit of the licence? Is the licensor the proprietor of the rights? If not, will the licensee require the proprietor be made a party to the licence? Consider the possible competition law consequences of adding extra parties.
Standard licences
•	Is there to be licensing in several jurisdictions, or a number of licences in one jurisdiction? If so, is it necessary to prepare a standard form of licence to ensure uniformity?
Incentives
•	How can the licensee's incentive to promote the product be maximised? Consider, for example, a "best endeavours to promote" obligation and specific obligations.
Royalties
Consider the issues which may affect the level of royalties, such as:
degree of exclusivity;
nature of licensed technology;
location of licensee's jurisdiction;
period of licence;
relative bargaining positions of the parties;
whether know-how will also be licensed;
possible effect of specific warranties.
What royalty mechanisms will be used? Consider, for example:
higher royalty rates for higher turnover levels;
guaranteed minimum royalty levels;
up-front fee (as stand-alone or advance against royalties?);
basis for payment (for example, percentage of sales turnover (less agreed discounts), units of production or net profits).
Heads of agreement
Ensure they are non-binding and that both parties are aware that if they proceed with investment on this basis it is at their own risk.
Confidentiality
Does the confidentiality agreement cover key know-how and information?
Local laws
•	What level of protection is afforded under local law for the licensor's industrial designs? What local formalities are necessary for the licence of rights? Are there any mandatory local law provisions which override English law even if it is the chosen law of the contract? Consider local tax and competition laws. How are infringements dealt with in the licensee's territory?
Competition law
•	Do any of the proposed licence provisions raise competition law issues under UK or EU competition law? Consider the Chapter I and Chapter II prohibitions in the Competition Act 1998 and Articles 101, 102 and 34-36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The licence may be covered by the EU technology transfer block exemption (Regulation 316/2014) which came into effect on 1 May 2014, replacing the previous block exemption (Regulation 772/2004). Further, the licence may benefit from the exemption as a "retained exemption" under UK law. For further details on the block exemptions see Practice note, Competition law in patent exploitation.
Taxation
•	Will payments from the licensee's jurisdiction be subject to withholding tax? If so, is there a double taxation agreement between the countries involved?
 
Licence provisions
Definitions
•	Definitions must be accurately drafted; consider in particular:
"Intellectual Property Rights" (which must be wide enough to encompass the licensed rights, but not give away any rights that the licensor wishes to retain);
"Products" (which may need to be defined narrowly in order to restrict the range of products to which the licence applies); and
"Net Sales Value" (where it will be necessary to consider what deductions may be made from the sales price or value and whether the sales price or value used is, for example, to be the retail price or ex-works sales value).
Term
•	How long will the licence run? What provisions will there be for notice to terminate? Will there be provision for extension?
Grant
•	Is the licence to be exclusive, sole or non-exclusive - does the licensor see future opportunities for licensing in the territory? Is there an adequate minimum royalty stream if exclusive rights are granted? Can rights be converted back to non-exclusive if targets are not met?
Scope
•	Ensure that the territory is unambiguous. Will there be limitations on the purpose of use (manufacture, own use, marketing and sale)?
Sub-licensing; sub-contracting; assignment
• Which, if any, of these will be permitted? If sub-licensing is permitted, royalty provisions must be drafted to include supplies by sub-licensees. Will any distinction be drawn between assignment within the parties' groups and to third parties?
Conditions precedent
•	Does the licence need to be made subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent, such as the obtaining of regulatory, exchange control or tax consents? If so, consider specifying a time limit within which the conditions must be satisfied.
Quality controls; compliance with regulations
Consider provisions requiring the licensee to:
comply with quality standards specified by the licensor;
comply with applicable laws and regulations;
mark products in accordance with the licensor's instructions and use the get-up determined by the licensor;
provide samples of the products and items used in the manufacturing process for approval by the licensor;
allow the licensor access to the licensee's premises for the purpose of inspection.
Will any additional obligations (for example, requiring the licensee to contract on specified terms and deal with specific categories of dealers or customers) give rise to competition law problems?
Royalties
•	What is the royalty rate? Is there an initial up-front payment and, if so, will it be stand-alone or an advance against royalties? What payments are due and when? Will there be a minimum royalty? If so, what are the consequences of failing to meet the minimum? Is VAT expressly excluded, so that it is payable in addition to all payments under the licence? How will payments be made? If a foreign currency is involved, have conversion procedures been included? Is there provision for interest on late payments? What reporting obligations will the licensee have? Has the licensor reserved a right to inspect the licensee's accounting books and records?
Improvements
•	Who is to own the rights to improvements? Will the licensor have the right to use improvements owned by the licensee?
Warranties and indemnities
•	Can warranties be given regarding ownership of the intellectual property rights? Are such rights in the name of the licensor? Who is the registered proprietor of any registered rights, that is, registered designs? Has the licensor obtained an indemnity from the licensee in respect of product liability claims and will this be backed up by an obligation to insure against such claims on the part of the licensee?
Infringement of intellectual property rights
Will the licensor be prepared to give warranties and will the licensor be prepared to back any warranties by indemnifying the licensee against claims that the licensed rights infringe third party rights, or will the licensee be expected to carry out its own due diligence? Will the licensor have the right to control actions against third parties for infringement of the licensed rights? Will the licensee be required to co-operate in such actions? Who will bear the cost?
Who will receive the damages?
Confidentiality
Ensure that a clear confidentiality provision is incorporated.
Termination
•	Is the licence terminable automatically, on notice, on breach or on the occurrence of specified events? Are breaches remediable, and if so, what is the time limit? What are the consequences of termination? Is there to be termination on change of control? What will happen to the licensee's orders after termination: are they to be taken over by the licensor? Will the licensor buy unsold stocks from the licensee? Does the licensor require the licensee's co-operation in amending the recorded details of any registered rights?
Jurisdiction
•	Should the licence be governed by English law? Will disputes be made subject to the jurisdiction (exclusive or nonexclusive?) of the English courts, or will provision be made for arbitration? In the case of arbitration, will arbitrators be identified? Will provision be made for alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and, if so, will any specific type of ADR be specified?
Formal licence
If the licence includes a registered design, who will register the licence at the Designs Registry? The licensee will usually make the application to register their interest in the design (section 19(1), RDA). However, if title has passed under a written legal document, such as a licence agreement, the application may be made by the licensor, among others (section 19(2), RDA).
