      Comparison Sample: a sample of organisations providing Equivalent Services identified in accordance with paragraph 4.8 of this Schedule 7.

      Equivalent Services: services that are identical, or similar in all material respects, to the Benchmarked Services (including in terms of scope, specification, volume and quality of performance), are generally available within the UK and are supplied to a customer similar in size to the Customer over a similar period.

      Median Price: in relation to the Equivalent Services provided by a Comparison Sample, the median price of the relevant services over the previous 12-month period. If there are an even-numbered number of organisations in the Comparison Sample then the Median Price shall be the arithmetic mean of the middle two prices.

   **1.2** The Benchmarked Services shall be good value if the Fees attributable to the Benchmarked Services are, having regard to the Service Level Arrangements, less than or equal to [110]% of the Median Price for Equivalent Services provided by a Comparison Sample (Good Value).


## 2. Purpose and scope of Benchmark Review

   The purpose of the Benchmark Review shall be to establish whether the Benchmarked Services are Good Value.


## 3. Appointment of Benchmarker

   **3.1** Each Benchmark Review shall be performed by an independent third party appointed by agreement between the parties. [If the parties cannot agree on the independent third party within [NUMBER] Business Days of receipt by the Supplier of the Customer's written request, then the Benchmarker shall be [CONSULTANTS].]

   **3.2** The Supplier has the right, in its absolute discretion, at any time to require the Benchmarker to enter into an appropriate and reasonable confidentiality undertaking directly with it.

   **3.3** Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses relating to a Benchmark Review, except that the costs and expenses of the Benchmarker shall be shared equally by the parties.

   **3.4** The Benchmarker shall conduct the Benchmark Review by applying the following general principles and criteria:

      **(a)** benchmarking shall be carried out in an independent and objective manner;

      **(b)** the Benchmarker shall be jointly instructed by the parties;

      **(c)** benchmarking shall be truly comparative in respect of the technology, services and service levels;

      **(d)** benchmarking shall be structured and undertaken in a way that causes the minimum disruption possible; and

      **(e)** immediately following selection of the Benchmarker, the parties and the Benchmarker shall (all acting reasonably and in good faith) agree the general principles and method of benchmarking.

   **3.5** The Supplier shall not be deemed to be in breach of this agreement for any failure to perform any obligation under this agreement (nor shall it be liable for Service Credits) where such failure results from any disruption to the Supplier's performance as a result of disruption caused by the Benchmarker.


## 4. Benchmarking process

   **4.1** The instructions to the Benchmarker shall require the Benchmarker to produce, and to send to each party for approval, a draft plan for the Benchmark Review within [NUMBER] Business Days after the date of appointment of the Benchmarker. The plan shall include:

      **(c)** a description of the benchmarking methodology to be used; and

      **(d)** details of any organisations providing Equivalent Services that the Customer, having consulted with the Supplier (and including any organisations providing Equivalent Services reasonably proposed by the Supplier), proposes should be included within the Comparison Sample.

   **4.2** In carrying out the benchmarking analysis, the Benchmarker shall have regard to the following matters when performing a comparative assessment of the Benchmarked Services:

      **(a)** the contractual and business environment under which the Equivalent Services are being provided;

      **(b)** any front-end investment and development costs and expenses;

      **(c)** the relevant supplier's risk profile, including the financial, performance and liability risk (including any limitation or exclusion or limitation of the Supplier's liability under this agreement) associated with the provision of the Equivalent Services as a whole; and

      **(d)** any other factors reasonably identified by the Supplier which, if not taken into consideration, could unfairly cause the Supplier's pricing to appear non-competitive.

   **4.3** Each party shall give notice in writing to the Benchmarker and to the other party within [NUMBER] Business Days after receiving the draft plan, advising whether it approves the draft plan or, if it does not approve the draft plan, suggesting amendments to that plan. Neither party may unreasonably withhold its approval of the draft plan and any suggested amendments shall be reasonable.

   **4.4** Where a party suggests amendments to the draft plan under paragraph 4.3, the Benchmarker shall, if it believes the amendments are reasonable, produce an amended draft plan. paragraph 4.2, paragraph 1 and paragraph 4.3 shall apply to any amended draft plan. If the Benchmarker believes that the suggested amendments are not reasonable, the Benchmarker shall discuss the amendments with the parties to reach a resolution. If the parties are unable to agree a resolution within [NUMBER] Business Days of the matter first being referred to each of them by the Benchmarker for discussion, then such matter shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

   **4.5** Failure by a party to give notice under paragraph 4.3 shall be treated as approval of the draft plan by that party.

   **4.6** Once the plan is approved by both parties, the Benchmarker shall carry out the Benchmark Review in accordance with it. Each party shall, to the extent it is not precluded from doing so by confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, provide the information described in the plan, together with any additional information reasonably required by the Benchmarker.

   **4.7** The Benchmarker shall share with the parties, in an even-handed manner, all data relating to the benchmarking and the Benchmarking Report to the extent that it is lawfully able to do so.

   **4.8** The selection of the Comparison Sample (both in terms of number and identity of entities) shall be a matter for the Benchmarker's professional judgment, but such sample shall not include entities providing Equivalent Services in offshore jurisdictions if, and to the extent that, the Supplier is not itself providing the Benchmarked Service offshore.

   **4.9** In conducting the Benchmark Review, the Benchmarker shall apply correction factors to the information to take account of reasons for difference in accordance with their professional judgment. Such normalisation information shall be available for approval by the parties before the production of the Benchmarking Report.

   **4.10** The Benchmarker shall perform the Benchmark Review in a fully transparent and open manner, and shall promptly provide the Customer and the Supplier with full details of all data and methodologies employed at all stages of the Benchmark Review.


## 5. Benchmark Report

   **5.1** The Benchmarker shall prepare a Benchmark Report setting out its findings. Those findings shall:

      **(a)** include a finding as to whether or not the Benchmarked Services are Good Value;

      **(b)** include other findings regarding the quality and competitiveness or otherwise of the Services; and

      **(c)** if the Benchmarked Services are not Good Value, specify the changes that would be required to the Services, and in particular to the Fees, in order to make the Benchmarked Services Good Value.

   **5.2** If the Benchmarking Report states that the Managed Services, Fees or Service Levels (or any part of them) that are benchmarked are not Good Value then clause 13.2 shall apply.
