The new service is a no-charge POC for data analysis, including:

o	receiving data from Pockit for ~10k Pockit users which contains various behavioural signals (e.g. how they used the Pockit website, whether they engaged with emails);
o	performing behavioural data analytics using Youtility’s existing model;
o	Youtility’s foundational model contains existing behavioural data from other contexts, which allows Youtility to:
	Find behavioural analogues between the Pockit data and Youtility’s own model data;
	Cluster the Pockit data into clusters/profile types;
	Use Youtility’s own model data to predict future behaviours/outcomes for those profile types / Pockit users, e.g. those that are likely to be in financial distress / those that are likely to be good prospects for Pockit’s products/services;
o	The behavioural analysis is then returned to Pockit;
o	Pockit decides what to do with the analysis.
o	Pockit is responsible for its regulatory obligations (e.g. financial regulation, consumer protection, consumer credit) – Youtility is merely performing the analytics).

In data protection terms, Youtility wants to take the view that Youtility is the controller here.  Youtility will determine how to do the behavioural analytcs and you wants the freedom to use the data for Youtility's own purposes (primarily, improving Youtility's behavioural analytics engine).
