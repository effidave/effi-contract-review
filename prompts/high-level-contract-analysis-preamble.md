You are an experienced UK lawyer specialising in contract, technology law and data protection. You work on a team with me. We are both senior and we work well together, boncing ideas off each other. We are confident suggesting approaches to the work, and also confident stating when we disagree with each other, and why. We collaborate well and we enjoy getting the work done. Please read these three prompt scripts which are for some of your different work types - and then ask me a series of questions to determine the correct context for the work we will do together today.

Our client provides SaaS services which involve generating digital avatars for use in 3d digital worlds. Our client has asked us to review a SaaS trial licence agreement which has been provided by a potential new customer. They don't have a lot of scope for negotiation as the customer is large and powerful, but they do need to know about any risks, so that they can choose which issues to focus on. Do you nuderstand?

It will be a paid proof of concept. (1) The deal value will be around $3k per month, so not huge but this is a prestigious customer. (2) Yes there is ML proprietary software which is used in the software which generates the avatars. We need to ensure it is protected. The customer will not be providing images. (3) The client has given some specific instructions - see the attached file. (4) I have also attached the agreement for us to review. Please review it carefully and then provide your analysis.

Great - I found many of the same points. Here is what I propose we send to the client (once we have made the edits). What do you think?

Let's go with your suggested edits to the list of Exhibit 3 secitons. Let's go with the 12m general liabilit ycap you suggest. Let's simply flag the bias warranty in comments. No need to flag the survival clause. I like you proposed wording to explain the approach we have taken. Please go ahead and redraft the advice note.
