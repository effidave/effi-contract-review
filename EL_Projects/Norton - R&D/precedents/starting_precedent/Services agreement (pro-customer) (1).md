introduce any new contractual or customary practice concerning the making of any lump sum payment on the termination of employment of any employees listed on the Supplier's Provisional Staff List; and
replace any of the Supplier Personnel listed on the Supplier's Provisional Staff List or deploy any other person to perform the Services (or the relevant part) or terminate or give notice to terminate the employment or contracts of any persons on the Supplier's Provisional Staff List[, except as a result of a disciplinary process properly carried out].
The Supplier shall promptly notify the Customer or, at the direction of the Customer, the Replacement Supplier, of any notice to terminate employment or engagement given by the Supplier or any subcontractor to, or received by the Supplier or any subcontractor from, any persons listed on the Supplier's Provisional Staff List regardless of when that notice takes effect.
Each party shall co-operate [(and the Customer shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that the Replacement Supplier co-operates)] to fulfil any requirement to inform and consult appropriate representatives in relation to any relevant transfer under the Employment Regulations that results from a Service Transfer.
[At least [NUMBER] days before OR within [NUMBER] days after] the Service Transfer Date, the Supplier shall provide to the Customer, or any Replacement Supplier nominated by the Customer, in respect of each person on the Supplier's Final Staff List who is an Exit Transferring Employee:
pay slip data for the most recent month;
cumulative pay for tax and pension purposes;
cumulative tax paid;
tax code;
details of voluntary deductions from pay; 
a copy of the personnel file or other records regarding the service of the Exit Transferring Employee; and
bank or building society account details for payroll purposes.
The Supplier shall, and shall procure that each subcontractor shall, perform and discharge all its obligations in respect of all the Exit Transferring Employees arising in the period up to and including the Service Transfer Date. 
The Supplier shall indemnify the Customer and Replacement Supplier against all Losses incurred by the Customer or Replacement Supplier as a result of:
any failure by the Supplier or any subcontractor to comply with paragraph 6.11;
any failure by the Supplier or any subcontractor to comply with its obligations under the Employment Regulations in respect of any Exit Transferring Employee;
anything done or omitted to be done by the Supplier or any subcontractor in respect of any Exit Transferring Employee on or before the Service Transfer Date; or 
any claim or threatened claim by any person employed or engaged (or formerly employed or engaged) by the Supplier or any subcontractor who alleges that they have transferred to the Customer or the Replacement Supplier by virtue of this agreement or the Employment Regulations but whose name is not included in the Supplier's Final Staff List as an Exit Transferring Employee. This indemnity includes all Losses arising out of the employment or engagement of the relevant person by the Customer or Replacement Supplier until that relationship is terminated and all Losses arising out of the termination itself[, provided that the Customer takes, or procures that the Replacement Supplier takes, reasonable steps to minimise those Losses].
[The Customer shall indemnify the Supplier against all Losses incurred by the Supplier as a result of anything done or omitted to be done by the Customer [or the Replacement Supplier] in respect of any Exit Transferring Employee(s) after the Service Transfer Date.]
The Supplier shall provide, and procure that each subcontractor provides, all reasonable co-operation to the Customer and any Replacement Supplier to ensure the smooth transfer of the Exit Transferring Employees on the Service Transfer Date.
