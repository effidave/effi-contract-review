5.0 Service Desk Incident Management SLA

   This section defines the commitments for managing and resolving unplanned service interruptions (Incidents).

   5.1. The Priority Matrix: Translating Technical Issues into Business Impact

      All incidents are categorised using a priority matrix to ensure that issues with the greatest business impact are addressed first.14 Priority is determined by assessing an incident's

      Impact (the extent of the issue's effect on the business) and Urgency (the speed at which the issue will negatively affect the business).

      Priority Level

      Description & Business Impact

      Examples

      P1 (Critical)

      A major business disruption affecting all or a significant majority of users. Business operations are halted.

      Total network failure, primary server crash, entire organisation unable to send/receive email.

      P2 (High)

      A significant business disruption affecting a large group of users or a department. A workaround may exist.

      CRM system inaccessible to the sales team, departmental file server offline.

      P3 (Medium)

      A limited business disruption. An individual user is unable to work effectively, or a non-critical function is failing.

      Single user's computer failing to start, network printer unavailable.

      P4 (Low)

      Minimal or no business disruption. Minor technical issues or "how-to" questions.

      Request to change an email signature, question about a software feature.

   5.2. The SLA Clock: Our Key Metrics Defined

      The journey of a support ticket is measured by three key milestones:

      **●** Acknowledgement Time: The time from when a ticket is created to when an automated confirmation is sent to the user. This confirms the request has been logged in our system.15

      **●** Response Time (Time to Commence Work): The time from ticket creation until a qualified engineer has reviewed the ticket, confirmed its priority, and begun active work on resolving the issue. This is marked by the first meaningful,

         non-automated communication from the engineer.15

      **●** Resolution Time: The total time from ticket creation until the service has been fully restored, confirmed with the user, and the ticket is closed.14

         SLA Pause Conditions: The SLA clock will be temporarily paused when resolution is dependent on factors outside of our direct control. The clock resumes as soon as the dependency is met. This ensures fair and accurate performance measurement.18 Common pause conditions include:

      **●** Waiting for a response, information, or testing from the Customer.

      **●** Waiting for action from an external third-party vendor (e.g., an ISP or software manufacturer).

   5.3. Our Service Level Targets for Incidents

      The following table outlines our standard SLA targets for incidents, measured during SLA Measurement Hours (8:00 AM - 6:00 PM, Mon-Fri).

      Priority Level

      Response Target

      Resolution Target

      P1 (Critical)

      < 5 minutes

      < 15-30 minutes

      < 4 business hours

      P2 (High)

      < 15 minutes

      < 1-2 business hours

      < 8 business hours (1 business day)

      P3 (Medium)

      < 1 hour

      < 4 business hours

      < 3 business days

      P4 (Low)

      < 4 business hours

      < 8 business hours (1 business day)

      < 5 business days

6.0 Change Management SLA

   The primary objective of our Change Management process is to enable beneficial changes to be made with minimum disruption to IT services, governed by the ITIL framework.11 This is achieved through a controlled process of risk assessment, planning, and authorisation.

   6.1. ITIL Change Types

      We classify changes into three types to manage risk effectively 20:

      **●** Standard Changes: Low-risk, common, pre-authorised changes.

      **●** Normal Changes: Changes that require formal review and authorisation before implementation.

      **●** Emergency Changes: Urgent changes required to resolve a major incident.

   6.2. Standard Changes: Policy and SLA

      **●** Definition: Low-risk, frequently performed activities that follow a documented, pre-authorised procedure.20 Because their risk is minimal, they do not require individual CAB approval.

      **●** Examples: Creating a new user account, installing a pre-approved application, replacing a keyboard.

      **●** SLA Metric: The SLA is based on Fulfilment Time. Requests are typically submitted via our service catalogue.

   6.3. Normal Changes: Policy and SLA

      **●** Definition: Non-emergency modifications that are not pre-authorised and require a formal Request for Change (RFC) to be submitted for risk assessment and CAB approval.20

      **●** Examples: Upgrading a core business application, migrating a server, implementing a new firewall.

      **●** SLA Metric: The SLA is based on Lead Time. This is the minimum number of days an RFC must be submitted in advance of the planned implementation date to allow for proper planning and risk assessment.

   6.4. Emergency Changes: Policy and SLA

      **●** Definition: Changes that must be implemented with extreme urgency to resolve a major incident or remediate a critical security vulnerability.20

      **●** Examples: Applying a patch for a zero-day exploit, restoring a database to resolve a service outage.

      **●** SLA Metric: The SLA is tied directly to the associated P1 Incident Resolution

         Time. The formal process is bypassed for speed, with documentation completed retrospectively.11

      zero-day patch).

7.0 Request for Change (RFC) Procedure

   12

   For all Normal and Emergency changes, a formal Request for Change (RFC) must be submitted. This ensures all changes are properly documented, assessed for risk, and approved, which is critical for maintaining service stability.13 The RFC should contain the following information:

   **●** Unique ID: A unique identifier for tracking purposes.

   **●** Change Owner: The person responsible for the change project.

   **●** Priority: The priority level of the change (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

   **●** Description of Change: A clear outline of the IT services, software, or hardware that will be changed.

   **●** Reason for Change: The business case and justification for why the change is needed.

   **●** Impact Assessment: The expected positive impacts (e.g., ROI) and potential negative impacts of the change.

   **●** Risk Assessment: An outline of the risks identified (e.g., potential downtime) and the steps taken to mitigate them (e.g., back-out plan, testing).

   **●** Planned Implementation Date: The target date for the change.

8.0 Governance and Review

      Regular service review meetings, which we refer to as Technical Alignment Meetings (TAMs), will be held to discuss performance, review strategic alignment, and plan for future requirements. 4 For customers on our premium package, this service may be enhanced to include a

      virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) who provides strategic guidance on cybersecurity and compliance alignment. 24
