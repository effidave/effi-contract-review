They define how well the supplier needs to perform and the immediate financial consequences of failure. Service credits are a mechanism by which amounts are deducted from the amounts to be paid under the contract to the supplier if actual supplier performance fails to meet the performance standards set in the service levels. The main agreement may contain various other mechanisms to rectify poor service delivery. For more information, see . This note analyses how service levels may be set and used and the service credit schemes that may be employed to encourage good performance. The context is outsourcing transactions, but many of the principles referred to in the note are generally applicable.\n \nIn this standard document, the services in question are maintenance and support of specified on-premises software. It is assumed that, where cloud services are involved, support and maintenance may be conducted centrally by the cloud provider, so some of the provisions of this schedule may not be relevant (for example, it may not be possible to roll back to a previous version or release of the software, see ). For more on cloud support, see .\n \nTypically, software support SLAs are only drafted to deal with response and resolve times for operational defects which affect the functions of the software, and do not deal with wider security aspects (such as addressing security vulnerabilities that may be present in software).\n \nIn light of the increased prevalence, severity, and media scrutiny given to, cybersecurity attacks and the changing regulatory landscape in this area (see  and ) we have included some optional clauses in this standard document to widen the definition of Fault to also cover security vulnerabilities. However, this is approach is largely untested in the legal market and so may be pushed back against by software support vendors who may argue that it would be extremely difficult to set specific service levels relating to security, or may have their own standardised procedures already set up for this. The optional wording is therefore included to ensure that the security aspects of software support are not overlooked, and it may be that the parties will need to build upon these provisions (should it wish to address software security as well as remedying functional defects) to fit with what is technically achievable in practice.\n \nAlternatively, the parties may wish to draft and negotiate an entirely separate security level agreement to fit alongside a typical service level agreement for support services, to cover a broader spectrum of cybersecurity risks in addition to software vulnerabilities.\n \n \nSupply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking\n \nThe  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. A customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour.\n \nFor further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .\n \nNetwork and Information Systems Regulations 2018\n \nThe  came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the Cybersecurity Directive ((EU)2016/1148) (also known as the Network and Information Security or NIS Directive).

Like the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.\n \nFor a definition of an OES see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .\n \nOESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OES).
