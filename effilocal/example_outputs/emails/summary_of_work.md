Dear [CLIENT_CONTACT],

I have been through your feedback on the MSA and made the required edits.  The only changes I have made are:

•	I have added you as the Customer’s Authorised Representative who must sign off any changes to the scope / specification or anything which will incur charges (clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE]).
•	I have tidied up clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE] on suspension for non-payment to say that this does not apply if you are disputing an invoice in good faith (n.b. you must pay any non-disputed parts).
•	I have clarified that reasonable transition assistance is not chargeable (clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE]).
•	Added a right for SW to terminate for convenience on 14 days’ notice (clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE]) to mitigate the risk of escalating fees under clause 3.   As per your comment, I have removed [SUPPLIER'S] right to terminate for convenience.
•	I have removed arbitration (clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE]).
•	I have clarified that you need to agree subcontractors (clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE]).
•	I have added the insurance clause you requested (clause [CLAUSE_REFERENCE]).  N.b. they may push back on the “per claim” language and add a “per year” cap instead, or in addition.  Let’s see how they respond.

I have removed all internal comments, and so this version is suitable for sharing with Itransition.

Do you have any feedback on the SOW?  N.b. the SOW still has internal “For [CLIENT_COMPANY_INITIALS]:” comments which should be removed before sharing the SOW with Itransition.

Thanks,
[LAWYER_NAME]
