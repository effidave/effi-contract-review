    continuous monitoring. Environments are segregated per customer. We
    use managed database services with automated backups, snapshotting

    before submission. \> \> • **Automatic Translation:** Wiseflow

    environment, to translate fixed UI elements (labels, field names,

result in cumulative financial impact for enterprise customers. These
risks are mitigated through high availability architecture, formal
incident response, SLAs, and comprehensive data redundancy.

    impact would be temporary disruption to the customer's onboarding

    mitigated through controls, and financial impacts are limited to
    operational delays.

b.  What would happen to your customer if your product or services fail?
    \> Customers may experience delayed onboarding of their business
