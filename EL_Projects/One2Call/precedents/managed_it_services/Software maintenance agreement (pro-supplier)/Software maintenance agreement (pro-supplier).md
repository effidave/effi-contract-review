   **7.1** In consideration of the Services (excluding for this purpose any Optional Services and New Versions), the Customer shall pay the Charges set out in Part 2 of Schedule 2 and Part 2 of Schedule 3.

   **7.2** Charges for any New Version or Optional Services to the Customer shall be [determined in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 4 and] agreed in writing before performance or supply by the Supplier, and shall be charged and invoiced to the Customer by the Supplier (and paid by the Customer) following acceptance by the Supplier of the Customer's written order for such New Version or such Optional Service (as the case may be).

   **7.4** The Customer shall reimburse any [reasonable] [travel or subsistence] expenses incurred by the Supplier where such expenses are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of providing on-site support as part of the Services, provided that any request for reimbursement is in the form of a proper invoice accompanied by appropriate receipts.

Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.

   **7.6** All payments made by the Customer under this agreement are exclusive of VAT. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a valid VAT invoice. The Customer shall pay any stamp duties or similar transfer taxes imposed on the supplies made under this agreement and shall reimburse the Supplier for any such stamp duties or similar transfer taxes paid by the Supplier.

   **7.7** The Customer and the Supplier shall co-operate to minimise the amount of any Tax Deduction. If following the making of a Tax Deduction, the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion/ acting in good faith] that it (or any member of the Supplier's group) has received and retained any credit, relief or other benefit as a result of the Tax Deduction, the Supplier shall pay such amount to the Customer as the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion OR acting in good faith] would leave the Supplier in the same position as if the Customer had not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   **7.8** The Supplier may increase the Charges [following not less than three months' written notice] on an annual basis with effect from each anniversary of the date of this agreement in line with the percentage increase in the [Consumer Prices Index (all items) OR [APPROPRIATE INDEX]] in the preceeding 12 month period, and the first such increase shall take effect from the [first OR second] anniversary of the date of this agreement and shall be based the latest available figure for the percentage increase in the [Consumer Prices Index (all items) OR [APPROPRIATE INDEX]].

   **7.9** All amounts due under this agreement shall be paid by the Customer to the Supplier in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law).


## 8. Intellectual Property Rights

   **8.1** All Intellectual Property Rights in the Deliverables shall belong to the Supplier, and the Customer shall have no rights in respect of any of the Deliverables except as expressly granted under this agreement. The Customer shall do or procure to be done all such further acts and things and sign or procure the signature of all such other documents as the Supplier may from time to time require for the purpose of giving the Supplier the full benefit of the provisions of this clause 8.1.

   **8.2** The Supplier undertakes at its own expense to defend the Customer or, at its option, settle any claim or action brought against the Customer alleging that the use or possession of any of the Deliverables (or any part of them) by the Customer in accordance with this agreement infringes the UK Intellectual Property Rights of a third party (Claim) and shall be responsible for any reasonable losses, damages, costs (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by, or awarded against, the Customer as a result of or in connection with any such Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, Error! Bookmark not defined.8.2 shall not apply where the Claim in question is attributable to possession, use, development, modification or maintenance of the Deliverables (or any part thereof) by the Customer other than in accordance with the terms of this agreement, use of the Deliverables in combination with any hardware or software not supplied or specified by the Supplier, if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Deliverables not so combined, or use of a non-current release of the Software.
