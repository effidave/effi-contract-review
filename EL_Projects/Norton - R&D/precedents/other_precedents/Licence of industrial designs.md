The provisions of this clause shall continue to apply after the expiry or earlier termination of this agreement. 
Royalty
[On the Effective Date the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor the sum of £[AMOUNT] [and such sum shall not be returnable nor available for credit against royalties or any other sums payable by the Licensee under this agreement OR as an advance against royalties payable under clause 8.2].]
The Licensee shall pay to the Licensor a royalty of [NUMBER]% of the Net Sales Price of each Licensed Product that, in the Territory, is:
sold by the Licensee;
lent, leased, let on hire or sold on hire purchase by the Licensee;
supplied by the Licensee to any person otherwise than in clause 8.2(a) or clause 8.2(b); or
put into use by the Licensee,
provided always that in respect of any Licensed Product manufactured, used or supplied, only a single royalty shall be payable, and the royalty accrues on the date when the Licensed Product is used or supplied, the date it is supplied being the earliest of when it is invoiced, paid for, installed or delivered.
[Where the Licensee has granted any sub-licence pursuant to clause 12, the Licensee shall include, in its royalty payments, payments in respect of all activities set out in clause 8.2 which are carried out by or on behalf of the sub-licensee, and shall include records of such activities in the records it keeps and statements it submits pursuant to clause 8.11, clause 8.12 and clause 8.13.]
[If the payment calculated in accordance with clause 8.2 in respect of any Quarterly Period is less than the Minimum Royalty for that Quarterly Period then the Licensee shall, in addition, make such further payment as shall make the payment  (that was calculated in accordance with clause 8.2) up to the Minimum Royalty.]
All payments made by the Licensee under this agreement are exclusive of VAT. If any such payment constitutes the whole or any part of the consideration for a taxable or deemed taxable supply by the Licensor, the Licensee shall increase that payment by an amount equal to the VAT which is chargeable in respect of the taxable or deemed taxable supply in question, provided that the Licensor shall have delivered a valid VAT invoice in respect of such VAT to the Licensee. If any VAT invoice is delivered to the Licensee after the relevant payment has been made, the Licensee shall pay the VAT due within five Business Days of the Licensor delivering a valid VAT invoice. If the Licensee fails to comply with its obligations under this clause, it shall additionally pay all interest and penalties, which arise directly or indirectly to the Licensor because of the Licensee's failure.
All royalties and other sums payable under this agreement shall be paid free and clear of all deductions and withholdings unless the deduction or withholding is required by law. If any deduction or withholding is required by law the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor such sum as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Licensor with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding.
Royalties and any other sums payable under this agreement shall be paid in sterling to the credit of a bank account to be designated in writing by the Licensor.
Royalties payable under this agreement shall be paid within 30 days of the end of each successive Quarterly Period[, and for the purpose of converting the local currency of the Licensee (in which such royalties arise) into sterling, the rate of exchange to be applied shall be the rate of exchange applied by the [London] bankers to the Licensor for the purchase of sterling with such foreign currency as at the close of business on the date when the relevant payment first becomes due].
In the event of any delay in paying any sum due under this agreement by the due date, the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor:
interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [4]% per annum above [FULL NAME OF BANK]'s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Licensee shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount; and
an amount equal to any penalties incurred by the Licensor as a direct result of the delay.
[If the Licensee is prohibited by a governmental authority in any country from making any payment due under this agreement then the Licensee shall, within the prescribed period for making such payment, use its best endeavours to secure from such authority permission to make such payment and shall make it within [seven] days of receiving such permission. If such permission is not received within [30] days of the Licensee making a request for such permission then, at the option of the Licensor, the Licensee shall either deposit the payment in the currency of the relevant country in a bank account designated by the Licensor within such country or make the payment to a Group company of the Licensor designated by the Licensor and having an office in the relevant country or in another country designated by the Licensor.]
At the same time as payment of royalties falls due, the Licensee shall submit or cause to be submitted to the Licensor a statement in writing recording the calculation of such royalties payable, and in particular:
the Quarterly Period for which the royalties were calculated;
the number of Licensed Products supplied or used during the Quarterly Period;
the number of Licensed Products manufactured during the Quarterly Period but not yet supplied;
the Net Sales Price of each Licensed Product supplied or used during the Quarterly Period;
the amount of royalties due and payable;
the amount of any withholding or other income taxes deductible or due to be deducted from the amount of royalties due and payable; and
any other particulars the Licensor may reasonably require.
The Licensee shall keep proper records and books of account showing the description and price of Licensed Products supplied or put into use. Such records and books shall be kept separate from any records and books not relating solely to the Licensed Products and be open during normal business hours to inspection and audit by the Licensor (or its authorised representative), who shall be entitled to take copies of or extracts from the same. If such inspection or audit should reveal a discrepancy in the royalties paid from those payable under this agreement, the Licensee shall immediately make up the shortfall and reimburse the Licensor in respect of any professional charges incurred for such audit or inspection. Such right of inspection of the Licensor shall remain in effect for a period of [one] year after the termination of this agreement.
Within [30] days of the end of each calendar year the Licensee shall submit to the Licensor a written statement certified by the Licensee's auditors of the aggregate Net Sales Price of Licensed Products supplied or put into use by the Licensee in that year, and the amount due to be paid for that year under this clause 8. In the event that such statement shows that the amount paid by the Licensee is less than the amount due, the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor within [seven] days of the submission of the statement an amount equivalent to the difference between the amount paid and the amount due.
The provisions of this clause 8 shall remain in effect notwithstanding termination or expiry of this agreement until the settlement of all subsisting claims by the Licensor.
Protection of the Intellectual Property Rights [and Technical Information]
The Licensee shall immediately notify the Licensor in writing giving full particulars if any of the following matters come to its attention:
any actual, suspected or threatened infringement of any of the Intellectual Property Rights.
[any actual, suspected or threatened unauthorised disclosure, misappropriation or misuse of the Technical Information.]
any actual or threatened claim that any of the Registered Designs is invalid.
any actual or threatened opposition to any of the Registered Designs.
any claim made or threatened that exploitation of any of the Intellectual Property Rights [or the Technical Information] infringes the rights of any third party.
any person applies for, or is granted, a registered design by reason of which that person may be, or has been, granted, rights which conflict with any of the rights granted to the Licensee under this agreement.
any application is made for a licence of right under any Design Right; or
any other form of attack, charge or claim to which the Intellectual Property Rights [or Technical Information] may be subject.
In respect of any of the matters listed in clause 9.1:
the Licensor shall, in its absolute discretion, decide what action if any to take, if any;
the Licensor shall have exclusive control over, and conduct of, all claims and proceedings;
the Licensee shall not make any admissions other than to the Licensor and shall provide the Licensor with all assistance that it may reasonably require in the conduct of any claims or proceedings; and
the Licensor shall bear the cost of any proceedings and shall be entitled to retain all sums recovered in any action for its own account.
The provisions of sections 101, 101A and 234 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and section 24(F) of the Registered Designs Act 1949 (or equivalent legislation in any jurisdiction), are expressly excluded.
[If any third party infringement of any of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Territory interferes materially in the Licensee's business in the Licensed Products, subject to receiving advice from experienced intellectual property counsel that infringement proceedings stand a reasonable chance of success, the Licensee may commence proceedings and may require the Licensor to lend its name to such proceedings and provide reasonable assistance, subject to the Licensee giving the Licensor an indemnity in respect of all costs, damages and expenses that it may incur, including an award of costs against it, directly resulting from the Licensor's involvement in such proceedings. Where such proceedings are conducted by the Licensee, the Licensee may apply up to [50]% of all royalties due under clause 8 subsequent to the date of notification by the Licensee to the Licensor of the relevant infringement towards any costs directly incurred in relation to the proceedings. Any waiver of royalties by the Licensor shall only apply for as long as the Licensee actively pursues and properly conducts the proceedings. Any damages recovered by the Licensee in the proceedings shall first be applied to compensating the Licensor for any royalties waived under this clause 9.4.]
Nothing in this agreement shall constitute any representation or warranty that:
any Intellectual Property Right is valid or relevant to the Licensed Products;
any Registered Design (if an application) shall proceed to grant or, if granted, shall be valid; or
the exercise by the Licensee of rights granted under this agreement will not infringe the rights of any person.

[In this clause:
Applicable Law: means all applicable laws, statutes, regulations [and codes] from time to time in force.
Losses: means all liabilities, damages, losses (including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of reputation, loss of savings and loss of opportunity), fines, expenses and costs (including all interest, penalties, legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and [reasonable] professional costs and expenses).

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Licensor shall not be liable to the Licensee for any costs, expenses, loss or damage (whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether economic or other) arising from the Licensee's exercise of the rights granted to it under this agreement.
The Licensee shall indemnify the Licensor against all Losses incurred by the Licensor as a result of:
any claim that the supply, receipt or use of any of the Licensed Products (Infringing Materials) infringes the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. 
[[any claim by a third party arising out of or in connection with] defective Licensed Products supplied by the Licensee, to the extent that the defect is attributable to the acts or omissions of the Licensee;]
[any damage to property arising out of or in connection with the acts or omissions of the Licensee;]
[any action (including any investigation) by a Regulator or governmental authority arising out of or in connection with the Licensee's [acts or omissions OR breach of this agreement, negligence or failure to comply with Applicable Laws in the performance of this agreement];]
[any breach of clause [NUMBER] of this agreement. ]
[the enforcement of this agreement.]
The Licensee will not be liable under the indemnity in clause 10.3(a) to the extent that the actual or alleged infringement arises [directly] from:
any changes made to the Infringing Materials without the Licensee's prior written consent [which will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed];
instructions, information or materials provided by the Licensor for the development of the Infringing Materials [, provided that the Licensee will not be relieved of liability where it knew or suspected (or should have known or suspected) that compliance with any instruction or the inclusion of any information or materials may result in infringement but did not notify the Licensor;
the use of the Infringing Materials in combination with any other materials not supplied or approved by the Licensee [, which approval will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed]; or
the use of the Infringing Materials for a purpose or in a manner not authorised by the Licensee or the failure of the Licensor to adhere to the Licensee's [reasonable] instructions for the use of the Infringing Materials.
[The [indemnity OR indemnities] in clause 10.3 [applies OR apply] whether or not the Licensor has been negligent or at fault.
OR
The Licensee will not be liable under the [indemnity OR indemnities] in clause 10.3 to the extent that any Losses result from the Licensor's breach of this agreement, negligence or wilful misconduct].
If any third party brings a claim against the Licensor, or notifies the Licensor of its intention to do so, and that claim may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under an indemnity (Claim), the Licensor shall:
as soon as reasonably practicable, give written notice of the Claim to the Licensee, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;
[subject to clause 10.7] allow the Licensee, at the Licensee's cost, to conduct all negotiations and proceedings in relation to the Claim and to settle or compromise the Claim, provided that the Licensee must not settle or compromise the Claim [without the prior written consent of the Licensor (consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) OR unless it involves only the payment of money by the Licensee and includes a complete release of the Licensor;
not[, subject to clause 10.7 and the Licensee's full compliance with clause 10.8,] make any admission of liability, settlement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Licensee [(that consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed)] [, provided that the Licensor may settle the Claim (after giving prior written notice of the terms of settlement (to the extent legally possible) to the Licensee, but without obtaining the Licensee's consent), if the Licensor [reasonably] believes that failure to settle the Claim would be prejudicial to it in any material respect]; and
provide the Licensee with reasonable information, assistance and co-operation in responding to and defending the Claim[, subject to the Licensee's compliance with clause 10.8(c)]. [This duty includes the Licensor giving the Licensee [and the Licensee's professional advisers] access at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to:
its premises and those of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers involved in the Claim; and 
any relevant accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Licensor, 
so that the Licensee [and the Licensee's professional advisers] can examine them and take copies (at the Licensee's expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim.
If the Licensee does not assume control over the defence of a Claim [within [NUMBER] days of OR promptly following] receipt of the notice under clause 10.6(a), the Licensor may defend the Claim in any way it deems appropriate at the Licensee's expense.
If the Licensee assumes control over the defence of any Claim, the Licensee shall:
defend the Claim diligently, using competent counsel and in such a way as not to bring the reputation of the Licensor into disrepute;
have regard to the interests and reputation of the Licensor in its conduct of the Claim;
reimburse the Licensor for any costs incurred under clause 10.6(d);
ensure that the Licensor is granted access to all relevant documents connected with the Claim and keep the Licensor informed, at regular intervals, regarding negotiations, litigation and other material matters concerning the Claim; and
[comply with all reasonable directions given by the Licensor in relation to the Claim OR allow the Licensor to join in the defence of the Claim with counsel of its choice at its own expense.]
[The failure of the Licensor to comply with the indemnification procedures in clause 10.6 does not relieve the Licensee of any obligation to indemnify the Licensor. 
OR
The Licensee's liability under each indemnity for third party claims in clause 10.3 will be reduced to the extent that any Losses are caused by the failure of the Licensor to comply with the indemnification procedures in clause 10.6.
OR 
Liability under each indemnity for third party claims in clause 10.3(a) is conditional on the Licensor complying with the indemnification procedures in clause 10.6].
If a payment due from the Licensee under clause 10.3 is subject to tax (whether by way of direct assessment or withholding at its source), the amount of the payment shall be increased to ensure that the net receipt, after tax, to the Licensor is the same as it would have been were the payment not subject to tax.
[[Nothing in this clause requires the Licensor to mitigate any Losses it may claim under an indemnity OR the Licensor shall use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate any Loss it may suffer or incur as a result of an event that may give rise to a claim under an indemnity].]
[[Liability under the [indemnity OR indemnities] is limited under clause [NUMBER] OR Liability under the [indemnity OR indemnities] is unlimited].]
The Licensee shall, at its expense, carry product liability and comprehensive general liability insurance coverage of [£[AMOUNT] increasing annually in accordance with the UK Retail Prices Index OR an amount adequate to support its liabilities under this agreement].
