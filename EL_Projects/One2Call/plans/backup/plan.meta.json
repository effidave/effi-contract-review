      "description": "**DECISIONS LOG \u2014 For Client Advice Note**\n\nThis task captures key decisions made during the contract review and consolidation project. These should be communicated to the client in the final advice note.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURAL DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION S1: Document Architecture (Option B)**\n\n**Decision:** Adopt modular MSA structure with detachable Schedules and Annexes.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\nMSA (HJ7)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cover / Order Form (commercial details, service selection, term/notice overrides)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 1: Terms and Conditions (core legal terms)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 2: Data Protection (existing)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 3: Installation & Provisioning Services (NEW \u2014 common framework)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3A: Managed IT Services\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3B: Cyber Security Services\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3C: Cloud Management\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3D: Connectivity (Ethernet \u2014 36m/60d defaults)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3E: Telecoms (Business Comms adapted \u2014 24m/60d defaults)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Annex 3F: Hardware Provision & Maintenance\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Annex 3G: Mobile Services (Mobile Terms adapted \u2014 24m/30d defaults)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Schedule 4: Security Schedule (optional \u2014 for cyber services)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Schedule 5: Maintenance Schedule (from HJ1)\n```\n\n**Hierarchy:** Order Form (highest) \u2192 Annexes \u2192 Schedules \u2192 Schedule 1 (Terms and Conditions)\n\n**Rationale:** Provides flexibility to assemble contract per engagement while maintaining consistent core terms. Avoids repetition across service-specific documents.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION S2: Separate Mobile from Horizon**\n\n**Decision:** Create separate Annex for Mobile services (Annex 3G) \u2014 NOT combined with Horizon VoIP in Annex 3E.\n\n**Rationale:** Mobile terms have fundamentally different structure (25 clauses vs 11) and cover different subject matter:\n- Mobile: SIM cards, handsets, porting, roaming, network coverage, MultiNet, Hardware Fund, Network Provider rights\n- Horizon: VoIP, SBC, IP addresses, emergency services warning\n\n**Impact:** Annex 3E (Telecoms/VoIP) and Annex 3G (Mobile) are separate, detachable annexes.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION S3: Schedule 3 Common Framework**\n\n**Decision:** Extract common installation/provisioning provisions from Ethernet and Horizon terms into Schedule 3 (common framework), with service-specific details in Annexes.\n\n**Common provisions identified:**\n1. Site surveys\n2. Site preparation & amendments\n3. Installation obligations\n4. Commissioning & testing\n5. Acceptance testing (5 Working Days)\n6. Service demarcation point (framework)\n7. Equipment ownership & return\n8. Customer-supplied equipment\n9. Reservation of rights\n10. Appointment scheduling\n\n**Rationale:** Avoids repetition; ensures consistency across installed services.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION S4: Business Communications \u2192 Annex 3E (Keep Almost All)**\n\n**Decision:** Adapt Business Communications General Terms as the basis for Annex 3E (Telecoms), keeping almost all provisions intact.\n\n**CLAUSES TO KEEP:**\n- Cl 1: Definitions\n- Cl 2: Service provisions / No-resale\n- Cl 3: Fair use policies\n- Cl 4: Telephone numbers & services (entire clause)\n- Cl 5: Charges provisions\n- Cl 6: Call monitoring\n- Cl 7: Rental Equipment (7.1-7.9)\n- Cl 8: Compliance with legislation\n- Cl 10: Paying charges\n- Cl 11: Term and termination (early termination formula, subsidy clawback)\n- Cl 12: Suspension\n- Cl 15: Termination consequences\n- Cl 16: Warranties\n- Cl 17: Network/Service changes\n- Cl 18: Minimum term/spend\n- Cl 19: Changes to agreement\n- Cl 20: General provisions (as applicable)\n\n**CLAUSES TO REMOVE (MSA covers):**\n- Cl 9: Data Protection \u2192 replace with reference to MSA Schedule 2\n- Cl 13: Limitation of Liability \u2192 MSA cl 19 covers\n- Cl 14: Force Majeure \u2192 MSA covers\n- Cls 21-27: General/Boilerplate (Notices, Entire Agreement, Waiver, Severability, Third Party Rights, Assignment, Governing Law) \u2192 MSA covers\n\n**Rationale:** Business Communications is comprehensive and telecoms-specific. Rather than extracting individual provisions, keep it substantially intact as Annex 3E. Only remove clauses that would duplicate MSA core terms.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION S5: Mobile Terms \u2192 Annex 3G (Keep Almost All)**\n\n**Decision:** Adapt Mobile Services Terms as the basis for Annex 3G, keeping almost all provisions intact.\n\n**CLAUSES TO KEEP:**\n- Cl 1: Provision of Services (SIM/Equipment; Connection Date)\n- Cl 2: Phone Number & SIM (ownership; lost/stolen; porting)\n- Cl 3: Services & Coverage (roaming; content licence)\n- Cl 4: Limitation of Services (coverage; MultiNet Service)\n- Cl 5: Disruption to Services\n- Cl 6: Suspension of Services (GSM Gateway prohibition)\n- Cl 7: Equipment (risk; title; warranty; network-locked)\n- Cl 8: Orders & Charges (Bundles; bolt-ons; Hardware Fund)\n- Cl 9: Software Licence\n- Cls 10-17: Use obligations, security, responsible use, messaging, age-restricted\n- Cl 18: Ending Agreement (30 days' notice; Cancellation Fee; PAC; porting)\n- Cl 19: Effect of Ending (Disconnection; forfeit Hardware Fund)\n- Cl 20: Variations (30 days' notice; RPI-linked)\n- Cl 21: Intellectual Property\n- Cl 23: Privacy (Network Provider data sharing \u2014 mobile-specific)\n- Cl 24: Third Party Rights (Network Provider enforcement rights)\n- Cl 25: Definitions (mobile-specific definitions)\n\n**CLAUSES TO REMOVE (MSA covers):**\n- Cl 22: Liability Limits \u2192 MSA cl 19 applies (\u00a3100k cap, not mobile's \u00a33,000)\n\n**KEY DIFFERENCE FROM 3E:** Keep cls 21, 23, 24 because they contain Network Provider-specific provisions that don't appear elsewhere. Network Provider can enforce directly under Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.\n\n**Rationale:** Mobile terms are supplementary to Business Communications (per cl 32 of old Mobile terms) but cover fundamentally different subject matter. The Network Provider references and unique features (MultiNet, Hardware Fund, SIM provisions) justify a separate, comprehensive Annex.\n\n---\n\n## MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION M1: Default Response Times**\n\n**Decision:** Set defaults in Schedule 5:\n- Response Time (>50% failure): 4 hours\n- Response Time (other faults): 8 hours\n- Business Hours: 8am-6pm Mon-Fri\n\n**Exception:** Phone systems default to 9 hours (not 8) via conditional clause in Schedule 5 cl 7.3(b).\n\n**Rationale:** Provides clean universal default with service-specific carve-out. Derived from Access Control/CCTV (8h) and Phone (9h) old terms.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M2: Service Credits**\n\n**Decision:** Offer menu of service credit options in Order Form (not defaults in Schedule 5):\n- \u00a350 per breach (fixed)\n- 5% of monthly fee per breach\n- 10% of monthly fee per breach\n- Custom amount\n\n**Rationale:** Service credits vary significantly by customer and service value. Better to select per Order than impose universal default.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M3: Equipment-Specific Exclusions**\n\n**Decision:** Use conditional clause in Schedule 5 (not separate Annexes) for equipment-specific exclusions.\n\n**Example clause:** \"If the Maintained Equipment includes telephone systems, the Maintenance Services shall not cover 2-wire devices unless expressly stated in the Order.\"\n\n**Rationale:** Only one equipment-specific exclusion identified (2-wire devices for phones). Doesn't justify separate Annexes.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M4: Alterations to Equipment**\n\n**Decision:** Keep HJ1's strict approach requiring prior written approval for alterations.\n\n**Rationale:** HJ1 approach is stricter than old terms (which allowed Customer alterations). Stricter approach protects Supplier's maintenance obligations.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M5: Equipment Destruction/Theft**\n\n**Decision:** Add softer termination right (30 days' notice) rather than old terms' approach (Customer remains liable).\n\n**New clause:** \"If the Maintained Equipment is destroyed, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, either party may terminate this Schedule on 30 days' written notice, and the Customer shall pay the Standard Maintenance Fees up to the date of termination.\"\n\n**Client comment required:** \"This clause departs from your old maintenance terms, which stated that theft/destruction of equipment would not affect the Customer's payment obligations. We have softened this to allow either party to terminate on 30 days' notice, with fees payable up to termination.\"\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M6: Early Termination**\n\n**Decision:** Add early termination clause to Schedule 5 \u2014 remaining fees due if Customer terminates before end of term.\n\n**New clause:** \"If the Customer terminates this Schedule before the end of the Service Initial Period or any Service Renewal Period (other than in accordance with clause 10.1 or for Supplier breach), the Customer shall pay to the Supplier all Standard Maintenance Fees that would have been payable for the remainder of that period.\"\n\n---\n\n**DECISION M7: Scope Changes**\n\n**Decision:** Add scope change clause to Schedule 5 \u2014 Supplier may adjust fees if maintained equipment changes materially.\n\n**New clause:** \"If the scope of the Maintained Equipment changes materially from that specified in the Order (including any increase in the number of users, devices, or software licences), the Supplier may, on reasonable written notice, adjust the Standard Maintenance Fees to reflect the changed scope.\"\n\n---\n\n## MSA CORE DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION C1: Price Increases \u2014 No Change Needed**\n\n**Decision:** MSA cl 11.7 already covers price increases adequately.\n\n**Existing provision:**\n- Pass-through of supplier increases: any time, 30 days notice\n- General inflationary increases: once per 12 months\n- Customer termination right: if single increase >10%, Customer can terminate within 14 days\n\n**Rationale:** Better than old maintenance terms which had no termination right.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION C2: Interest on Late Payment \u2014 No Change Needed**\n\n**Decision:** MSA cl 14.14 already covers interest (8% above BoE base rate).\n\n**Rationale:** Actually higher than old terms (which had 4% in some documents, 5% in others).\n\n---\n\n**DECISION C3: Liability Cap \u2014 No Change Needed**\n\n**Decision:** MSA cl 19.4 already has \u00a3100,000 liability cap per client instruction.\n\n**Rationale:** Client has already made commercial decision on cap level. This applies to ALL services including Mobile (replacing Mobile's \u00a33,000 cap).\n\n---\n\n## ANNEX 3E (TELECOMS) DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION V1: Emergency Services Warning Placement**\n\n**Decision:** Place 999/112 warning prominently at START of Annex 3E (not in Order Form).\n\n**Rationale:** Regulatory compliance requirement (Ofcom). Prominent placement in Annex ensures customers are clearly informed when they select VoIP services.\n\n**Client comment required:** \"This warning is a regulatory compliance requirement for VoIP services. Ofcom requires providers to inform customers about the limitations of VoIP emergency calling. Failure to provide adequate warning could expose One2Call to regulatory action and liability claims.\"\n\n---\n\n**DECISION V2: Equipment Maintenance via Order Form**\n\n**Decision:** Equipment Maintenance indicated in Order Form. If selected, Schedule 5 (Maintenance Schedule) applies to the Maintained Equipment specified.\n\n**Rationale:** Clean separation \u2014 Order Form selects services; Schedule 5 contains maintenance terms.\n\n---\n\n## RETIREMENT DECISIONS\n\n**DECISION R1: Retire Standalone Sale of Goods Terms**\n\n**Decision:** Retire the standalone \"Terms & Conditions for the Sale of Goods\" document.\n\n**Rationale:** The MSA (HJ7) already contains comprehensive goods provisions at clauses 4-8:\n\u2022 Cl 4: Goods Specification\n\u2022 Cl 5: Delivery (notes, location, late/short delivery, instalments)\n\u2022 Cl 6: Acceptance (48-hour deemed acceptance, 5-day defect notification)\n\u2022 Cl 7: Quality/Warranty (description conformity, repair/replace/refund, UCTA exclusions)\n\u2022 Cl 8: Title and Risk (risk on delivery, title on payment, retention provisions)\n\n**Impact:** For pure product sales with no ongoing services, One2Call should use the MSA with an Order that specifies Goods only.\n\n**Old Document Path:** `C:\\Users\\DavidSant\\effi-contract-review\\EL_Projects\\One2Call\\old_terms\\One2Call-Terms-and-Conditions-for-the-Sale-of-Goods\\`\n\n---\n\n**DECISION R2: Business Communications \u2192 Annex 3E (Not Retired)**\n\n**Decision:** Business Communications General Terms will be adapted as Annex 3E (Telecoms), NOT retired.\n\n**Rationale:** Business Communications contains comprehensive telecoms-specific provisions (numbering, rental equipment, fair use, suspension, etc.) that should be preserved. Rather than extracting individual clauses, adapt the document as Annex 3E with only minor removals (see Decision S4).\n\n**Old Document Path:** `C:\\Users\\DavidSant\\effi-contract-review\\EL_Projects\\One2Call\\old_terms\\One2Call-Business-Communications-General-Terms-and-Conditions.pdf\\`\n\n---\n\n**DECISION R3: Mobile Terms \u2192 Annex 3G (Not Retired)**\n\n**Decision:** Mobile Services Terms will be adapted as Annex 3G, NOT retired.\n\n**Rationale:** Mobile terms contain comprehensive mobile-specific provisions (SIM ownership, MultiNet, Hardware Fund, Network Provider rights) that should be preserved. Rather than extracting individual clauses, adapt the document as Annex 3G with only minor removals (see Decision S5).\n\n**Old Document Path:** `C:\\Users\\DavidSant\\effi-contract-review\\EL_Projects\\One2Call\\old_terms\\One2Call-Terms-and-Conditions-for-Mobile-Services-g-v1.1\\`\n\n---\n\n## BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS GAP DECISIONS\n\n**NOTE:** Following Decision S4, most Business Communications provisions are retained in Annex 3E rather than being extracted to MSA core or other locations. The below decisions remain valid for provisions that DO need to go elsewhere.\n\n**DECISION B7: Credit Check Consent**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 5.6 includes consent to credit checks.\n**Decision:** Add to MSA cl 14 (Charges).\n**Rationale:** Credit checking is a general commercial term that applies across all services, not service-specific.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B8: Call Monitoring Disclosure**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 6 requires Customer to disclose call monitoring to its staff.\n**Decision:** **KEEP IN ANNEX 3E** \u2014 not moved to MSA cl 18.\n**Rationale:** Call monitoring is telecoms-specific. Stays with other telecoms provisions.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION B12: Marketing Consent**\n\n**Gap:** Business Comms cl 14 provides marketing consent and right to use Customer name as reference.\n**Decision:** Add to MSA cl 24 (General).\n**Rationale:** This is a general commercial term that applies across the customer relationship, not service-specific.\n\n---\n\n*Additional decisions to be added as they are made during this project.*",

The Supplier shall notify the Customer promptly when the Response Time is paused and when it resumes.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThis provision is standard in IT service level agreements and protects the Supplier from SLA breaches caused by customer delays or third-party dependencies.
