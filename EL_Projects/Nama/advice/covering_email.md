**Re:** Masri Strategy — Privacy Policy and T&Cs Review

---

Hi Muath,

Good to hear the coaching side of things is up and running — sounds like a great use of your CRA experience.

I've reviewed the Privacy Policy and T&Cs for Masri Strategy and marked them up with comments. Overall they're in good shape, but there are a few gaps and some points I'd like your input on.

## Privacy Policy

The policy covers the main bases but was missing a few standard sections, which I've added:

- **Cookies** — you'll need this if you're using Google Analytics or similar
- **Right to complain to the ICO** — standard and expected
- **Changes to the policy** — standard
- **Purpose limitation statement** — important given Nama Economics operates two different business lines under the same company; this makes clear you won't repurpose coaching data for other activities

I've also flagged some areas that need clarification or tightening up — see the comments in the document, but the main ones are:

1. **Video recordings** — you mention collecting these but don't explain why or on what basis. Worth adding a sentence about purpose (quality assurance? so client can review session?) and where they're stored.

2. **Data retention** — "as long as necessary" is a bit vague. I'd suggest being specific (e.g. "2 years after your last session, or earlier on request").

3. **Free guide / marketing** — if downloading the guide automatically adds someone to your marketing list, the lawful basis should be consent, not legitimate interests. Worth clarifying how this works in practice.

4. **Processor agreements** — do you have DPAs in place with Google (for Gemini) and Loom? If you're just relying on their standard terms, that's probably fine, but worth checking you've accepted their DPA addendums.

5. **Cookie banner** — if you're using analytics, you may need a cookie consent tool on the website.

## Terms & Conditions

These are solid for a B2C coaching service. I've added a few comments but no structural changes needed. Main points:

1. **Digital content cancellation waiver (clause 3.2)** — the wording is slightly off. The statutory right is lost when you *grant* access, not when the customer accesses it within 14 days. I've suggested cleaner wording.

2. **24-hour cancellation policy (clause 4.2)** — just flagging that this doesn't override the 14-day statutory cancellation period for online purchases. You've covered this in clause 6.2(a), so no change needed — just worth being aware.

3. **WhatsApp** — is this a Business account or personal? If personal, there are data security implications (messages syncing to personal cloud backups). Worth switching to WhatsApp Business if you haven't already.

## Questions for You

Before we finalise:

- Where are coaching session recordings stored (Loom?) and for how long do you keep them?
- Is your WhatsApp a Business account?
- Have you accepted DPA terms with Google/Loom/Calendly? (Usually a checkbox in account settings)
- How is marketing consent captured when someone downloads the free guide?
- Do you have a cookie banner on the website?

## Nama Economics B2B Policy

You asked whether the Nama Economics (B2B consulting) privacy policy needs to change in light of Masri Strategy. Short answer: no, provided you keep the two privacy policies separate (which you are doing). The purpose limitation statement I've added to the Masri Strategy policy reinforces that data collected for coaching stays within that business line.

Let me know if you want to discuss any of this — happy to jump on a call.

Best,  
Dave
