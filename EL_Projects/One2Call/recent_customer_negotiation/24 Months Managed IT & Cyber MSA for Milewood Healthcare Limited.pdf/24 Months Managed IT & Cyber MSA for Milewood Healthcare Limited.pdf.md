2. GENERAL

   2.1. This schedule contains additional terms and conditions applicable to One2call IT Support Services. These apply in addition to the Company’s General Terms and Conditions.

   2.2. The Customer agrees that it will only use the Services in accordance with the provisions of the Contract and the Company’s reasonable instructions from time to time.

   2.3. In order to properly fulfil its obligations under the Contract, the Company may, at its sole discretion, install on the Customer’s network any necessary monitoring software that it may reasonably require.

   2.4. The Company may, at its sole discretion, suspend the Services (in whole or part) if the Company is entitled to terminate the Agreement for any reason.

3. SERVICE DESCRIPTION

   3.1. Service Desk

      3.1.1. Acting as the central hub for all IT-related incidents, requests, and inquiries, the Service Desk serves as the primary point of contact for all staff.

      3.1.2. Responsive to telephone calls, web chats, and emails, the Service Desk staff diligently logs all Incidents and Requests into the Company’s Helpdesk Management system. This process generates a distinctive ticket/case reference for each, facilitating effective tracking and management.

      3.1.3. The Company upholds a Service Desk dedicated to overseeing the logging, prioritisation, and resolution of all Incidents and Requests reported by the Customer or the Company itself. This is in accordance with the Service Desk description and Service Levels detailed in clauses 4 & 5.

      3.1.4. Users will receive a confirmation email upon reporting an Incident or Service Request to the Service Desk. This email will include the reference number for the logged ticket.

      3.1.5. The Service Desk collaborates with the User to determine the business impact and urgency of the Incident, crucial in calculating the priority and setting the target time for response. The Service Desk bears the responsibility of ensuring responses to Incidents are within these specified target times.

      3.1.6. Retaining ownership of all Incidents, the Service Desk closely monitors their progress against resolution targets. Any Incidents missing their target resolution will be escalated by the Service Desk to senior management within the Company. Immediate escalation awaits high-priority Incidents that miss their target resolution, with the Company providing written details to the Customer regarding the Incident and proposed rectification actions.

      3.1.7. Incidents and requests considered resolved by the Service Desk are automatically completed after 1 day, with the user receiving a notification. If the user believes the Incident is unresolved or incomplete, they can respond to the automatic completion notice, prompting the Service Desk to reopen the Incident if in an unresolved state, or create a new Incident.

      3.1.8. Resolution and completion of the Incident ticket occur once the service has been restored or a workaround provided. Root cause analysis or a permanent fix to a workaround is conducted through a problem ticket raised by the Service Desk. The Service Desk team ensures the completion of all Incidents, preventing them from being left open to check for recurrence.

      3.1.9. To resolve an incident or service request, the Service Desk may need information or communication from the Customer. In such cases, the Company attempts to contact the user for resolution. If contact cannot be established, the Company initiates the three-strike rule process, attempting contact at least 3 times through various communication methods. Failure to make contact results in marking the ticket as complete, with the user informed in writing.

      3.1.10. Once an Incident is completed, it cannot be re-opened. In such cases, the Customer contacts the Service Desk, and a new Incident is created and related to the original ticket.

4. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

   4.1. An Incident is described as a disruption in service, such as denied access to the User’s applications or a decline in service quality, leading to an unacceptably slow response. This is distinct from requests made to the Service Desk, such as configuring a printer or installing new equipment.

   4.2. The primary objective of Incident management is to swiftly restore service to a User or Users. This is often achieved by implementing an acceptable workaround to address the issue, while a separate investigation into the root cause is conducted as a problem.

   4.3. Incident Management Process

      Urgency

      Impact - The measure of the effect on processes, users and services, and financial impact.

      Impact - The measure of the effect on processes, users and services, and financial impact.

      P2

      Medium - Work functions impaired

      P2

      P2

      P3

      4.3.1. An Incident is recorded with the Service Desk, generating (or confirming) an Incident call reference number. The Company will make efforts to resolve the Incident based on the defined priority.

   4.4. Priority Level

      4.4.1. Priority is determined by assessing the business impact and urgency of an Incident. 'Impact' gauges the number of people affected by the Incident.

      4.4.2. 'Urgency' pertains to the speed required to resolve an Incident and reflects how quickly the impact will be felt by the business, such as meeting important deadlines.

      4.4.3. The Service Desk will collaborate with the affected User or Users to agree on the business Impact and Urgency of the Incident. If agreement is not achievable or there is uncertainty regarding the correct prioritization, the assessment will be escalated to senior staff at the Company and the Customer.

      4.5. The following table defines the priority to reflect the reality of the business impact of the event at the time it is occurring:

      Urgency

      Impact - The measure of the effect on processes, users and services, and financial impact.

      Impact - The measure of the effect on processes, users and services, and financial impact.

      Impact - The measure of the effect on processes, users and services, and financial impact.

      Low - Inconvenient

      P2

      P3

      P4

   4.6. Priority Level

      4.6.1. Incidence response – If applicable to the Customer Contract, the response target represents the time elapsed between logging the call with the Service Desk and the acceptance of the Incident by the relevant support team, upon assignment of a support technician. Incidents will only be accepted when all necessary information for progress and resolution has been supplied to the service desk. The acceptance will initiate an acknowledgment email to the User who reported the Incident. This email will include the Reference number for the ticket, which should be utilised in all subsequent correspondence with the Company.

5. SERVICE REQUEST FULFILLMENT

   5.1. The term 'Service Request' is used as a broad description encompassing various types of requirements that customers need fulfilled by the Company. Many of these involve small changes – being of low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, or a query seeking information.

   5.2. Examples of Service Requests include: a request for access, a request for relocation, a request to create a new account, a request to revoke access for a departing employee, assistance with using an application, a request to install additional software on a specific device, or a request to relocate desktop equipment.

   5.3. Extensive projects, involving the movement of several people, equipment, or applications, are treated as projects and are billed separately. They are managed by the Company's Account Management and/or Project Management teams.

   5.4. Customer Responsibilities for Service Request Fulfilment

      5.4.1. Requests should be logged via email/telephone/web with the Service Desk.

      5.4.2. When necessary, the Service Desk will issue a request for additional information or authorisation. This should be promptly completed and returned to avoid delays in fulfilling the request. The Service Request will be accepted once all information required to proceed with the request has been received.

6. 3RD PARTY DEPENDENCY

   6.1. In situations where the Company relies on third parties beyond its direct control, the Customer acknowledges that Response or Resolution Time may extend beyond the target. Throughout the provision of support hours, the Company shall keep the Customer informed in the event of potential delays beyond the Service Levels due to third-party dependency and seek assistance through management escalation as appropriate.

   6.2. The Customer is required to maintain external support contracts with core specialist applications and software vendors, such as accounting and additional specialists. While the Company may not be able to provide direct user support, it will act as an intermediary when appropriate. The Company will be responsible, wherever possible, for managing the solution through the third-party contractor.

7. EXCLUSIONS

   7.1. The Company reserves the right to exclude the following items:

   7.2. Parts, equipment, or software not covered by vendor/manufacturer warranty or support.

   7.3. The cost of any parts, equipment, or shipping charges of any kind.

   7.4. The cost of any software, licensing, or software renewal or upgrade fees of any kind.

   7.5. The cost of any 3rd party vendor or manufacturer support or incident fees of any kind.

   7.6. The cost to bring the Customer’s environment up to the minimum standards required to provide the Services.

   7.7. Service and repair made necessary by the alteration or modification of equipment other than that authorized by the Company, including alterations, software installations, or modifications of equipment made by Customer’s employees or anyone other than the Company or its subcontractors.

   7.8. Maintenance of applications/software packages, whether acquired from the Company or any other source unless otherwise specified.

   7.9. Software builds, operating system upgrades, or data transfer for new desktops, laptops, or servers introduced into the environment.

   7.10. Programming (modification of software code) and program (software) maintenance unless specified.

   7.11. Major network upgrades or projects.

   7.12. ISP or carrier-related issues if provided by a third-party service provider not contracted with via the

   Company.

   7.13. Instructor-led user training sessions.

   7.14. In the event that the Customer’s business continuity plan is invoked, the Service Levels will be temporarily suspended until such time as recovery actions are complete as agreed by the parties.

   7.15. On-site break-fix or implementation work unless specifically agreed within the order.

8. LOGGING AN INCIDENT

   8.1. Major Incidents (Priorities 1 or 2)

   8.2. Please report Major Incidents to the Service Desk via telephone at 01142300080 or through web chat. It is the responsibility of the Company employee receiving a telephone call or web chat reporting a Major Incident to ensure it is logged in the Service Desk software.

   8.3. Normal Incidents (Priorities 3 or 4)

   8.4. To create a ticket for Normal Incidents, you can use the customer support portal, email helpdesk@one2call.net, use web chat, or call the Service Desk at 01142300080.

9. SERVICE REVIEWS

   9.1. The Company will generate reports describing the service provided to the Customer in line with the relevant contract.

   9.2. Service review meetings will be held between the Company and the designated Customer

   Contract Manager, providing a forum to discuss service achievements and issues. Chaired by the Company Account Manager/Service Manager, these meetings will require representation from the customer at an appropriately senior level. The frequency and content of service review meetings/reports will align with the stipulations outlined in the relevant contract.

   9.3. If requested by the Customer, a contract review meeting will be held between the Company and the designated Customer Contract Manager approximately four months before contract renewal. This will provide a forum to discuss service achievements and issues during the current contract period and agree on any contractual changes for the next contract period. The review will be overseen by the Company Account Manager/Service Manager and will require representation from the customer at an appropriately senior level.

10. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES

   10.1. User Responsibility with the Service Desk

      10.1.1. Users are encouraged to provide a comprehensive description to the Service Desk when reporting an Incident or making a Request. This should include, where possible, details such as the device Asset Tag Number and error messages.

      10.1.2. Users should collaborate with the Service Desk and other Company staff, making themselves available to provide further information and responding to the Service Desk promptly. Timely cooperation is essential for incident resolution and testing of proposed solutions.

      10.1.3. To ensure the correct priority assignment, users should provide a realistic assessment of the Business Impact and Urgency. Exaggeration may lead to an inflated number of Incidents assigned a high priority, potentially causing "genuine" high-priority Incidents to miss their targets.

   10.2. Service Request Fulfilment

      10.2.1. Requests should be logged via email/telephone/web with the Service Desk.

      10.2.2. When applicable, the Service Desk will issue a request for additional information or authorisation. Users should promptly complete and return this request to avoid delays in fulfilling the Request. The Service Request will be accepted once all necessary information for actioning the Request has been received.

   10.3. General

      10.3.1. All Users bear the responsibility of exercising reasonable care and taking ownership for the systems, following the policies and procedures of the Customer.

      10.3.2. The Company is not responsible, under this agreement, for managing vendor warranties for equipment on the Customer's site that has not been supplied by the Company.

      10.3.3. In the event of a hardware-related Incident logged against an out-of-warranty item, the Customer should source any required parts, using the Company as needed. At this point, the SLA ceases to be applicable. The Company may provide a repair or replacement quotation for the faulty item, and relevant documentation/tickets will be raised as necessary.

      10.3.4. If a hardware-related Incident is logged against an item within the manufacturer's warranty, the Company will coordinate with the third party to obtain the replacement part. At this point, the SLA ceases to be applicable. The third party may provide labour for the replacement part, or the Company will provide the labour as per the contract.

      10.3.5. Provide contact details of an authorised person we can reach during out-of-hours emergencies.

      10.3.6  Notify One2Call in advance of any senior stakeholders who must be informed during a serious out-of-hours cyber event.

11. SERVICE WINDOWS

   11.1. The Company acknowledges that all services provided may require periodic changes, including, but not limited to:

   **•** Routine maintenance

   **•** Installation of critical security fixes

   **•** Installation or updates to hardware or application software

      26.6.2   If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 26.3 or in Clause 26.11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

      26.6.3   The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.

      26.6.4   If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 26.3 or in Clause 26.11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

      26.7    Mediation and jurisdiction

      26.7.1 The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

   **a)** to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;

   **b)** to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

      26.7.2   The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

      26.8    Cooperation with supervisory authorities

   **26.8.1** The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.

   **26.8.2** The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.

   **26.8.3** The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 26.5.2.

      **26.9** Governing Law

      The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

      **26.10** Variation of the contract

      26.10.1 The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

      26.11  Subprocessing

   **26.11.1** The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor’s obligations under such agreement.

   **26.11.2** The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 14.3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 14.6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

   **26.11.3** The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

   **26.11.4** The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 26.5.10, which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority upon request.

      26.12  Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services

   **26.12.1** The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

   **26.12.2** The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
