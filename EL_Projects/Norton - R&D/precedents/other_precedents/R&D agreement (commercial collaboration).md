Subject to clause 3.4, Foreground Intellectual Property shall vest in and be owned absolutely by the party creating or developing the Technology in respect of which it arises. To the extent that either party sub-contracts performance of any Project, that party shall ensure that any Foreground Intellectual Property arising from the work of its sub-contractor shall be assigned to it absolutely.
 To the extent that any Foreground Intellectual Property arises or is obtained in respect of Technology developed by the parties jointly or otherwise than solely by either party, it shall be jointly owned in equal and undivided shares by the parties. If any such jointly-owned Foreground Intellectual Property is registrable, [Party A] shall be responsible for the filing and prosecution of applications for registration on behalf of the parties and in their joint names in such countries as the parties agree in writing. [Party A] shall be responsible for the maintenance and renewal of any such registrations in such countries, subject to [Party B] co-operating in the provision of all necessary assistance, information and instructions and bearing an equal proportion of any fees and costs, including reasonable agents and lawyers fees, in relation to such registrations, provided that:
if only one party wishes to apply for registration in any country or countries, the party wishing to apply may do so [at its sole cost and expense] on behalf of both parties and in their joint names, and the party not making such an application shall provide the party making the application with all necessary assistance, information, and instruction;
neither party shall amend or abandon any registration in respect of which the parties are jointly registered without the other party's written consent; and
the party making an application for registration shall consult with the other party at reasonable intervals concerning the application for and maintenance of such registration.
Each party shall immediately give written notice to the other party of any actual, threatened or suspected infringement of any party's Background Intellectual Property or Foreground Intellectual Property, whether jointly or solely owned, or any unauthorised use of any party's Technology.

On the enforcement of any security of a kind referred to in this clause 11.3, [NAME OF PARTY], any administrative receiver of [NAME OF PARTY] or any person having the benefit of such security may assign any or all of the relevant rights to any person, but the other party's liability to any assignee in respect of those rights shall not be greater than if no assignment had taken place.]

No partnership or agency
Nothing in this agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership between any of the parties, constitute any party the agent of another party, or authorise any party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other party [except as expressly provided in clause[s] [NUMBER(S)]].
Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.

Waiver
A waiver of any right or remedy is only effective if given in writing [and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent right or remedy].
A delay or failure to exercise, or the single or partial exercise of, any right or remedy does not waive that or any other right or remedy, nor does it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this agreement.
If [one party gives notice to the other of the possibility that] any provision or part-provision of this agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend such provision so that, as amended, it is legal, valid and enforceable, and, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the intended commercial result of the original provision.

The Projects
Form of confidentiality undertaking
To: [Party A OR Party B], of [ADDRESS] (Discloser)
I understand and acknowledge that, by virtue of my relationship with [Party A OR Party B] (Recipient), including my duties as an [officer OR employee OR agent OR contractor] of the Recipient, pursuant to certain contractual arrangements between the Discloser and the Recipient, I will receive or become aware of information belonging or relating to the Discloser, its business, business plans, affairs or activities, which is confidential and proprietary to the Discloser and/or its customers and in respect of which I am bound by a strict duty of confidence (Confidential Information).
In consideration of the disclosure by the Discloser of Confidential Information, I undertake to the Discloser that I shall not at any time, whether before or after the termination of my relationship with the Recipient, directly or indirectly, disclose, divulge or make unauthorised use of any Confidential Information, save to the extent that such Confidential Information:
is publicly known at the time of disclosure to me; 
after such disclosure, becomes publicly known otherwise than through a breach of this undertaking by me; 
can be proved by me to have reached me otherwise than by being communicated by the Discloser, including being known to me prior to disclosure, or having been developed by or for me wholly independently of the Discloser, or having been obtained from a third party without restriction on disclosure; or
is required by law, regulation or order of a competent authority (including any regulatory or governmental body or securities exchange) to be disclosed by me, provided that, where practicable, the Discloser is given reasonable advance notice of the intended disclosure.
Upon the earlier of a request from the Discloser or the Recipient or the termination of my relationship with the Recipient, I will return to the Recipient all Confidential Information in my possession or control and will not retain any copies of the same.
I understand and acknowledge that this undertaking, and the obligations contained in it, will continue without limit of period.
This undertaking is governed by the laws of [England] and I submit to the [exclusive] jurisdiction of the [English] courts.
