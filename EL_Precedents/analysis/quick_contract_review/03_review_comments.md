## For [SUPPLIER] (Counterparty)

### Comment 1

> For [SUPPLIER]: Trial also extends to all group companies - is that ok?  Other parts of the licence look fine

**Referenced text:** "and its Affiliates"

---

### Comment 2

> For [SUPPLIER]: For a trial licence I normally remove warranties and indemnities and fall back to “as is”.  This largely depends on whether you are being paid / how much you are being paid.  From your email, I infer that you are prepared to accept some liability.

**Referenced text:** "Specifications.  [SUPPLIER] will use reasonable efforts to cause the [SUPPLIER] IP to perform or otherwise comply in all material respects in accordance with any specifications related to the [SUPPLIER] IP provided to [CUSTOMER] or otherwise made publicly available."

---

### Comment 3

> For [SUPPLIER]: N.b. you must disclose information about any of your suppliers/service providers/subcontractors who may have access to [CUSTOMER]’s confidential information, which includes any data which [CUSTOMER] puts into the [SUPPLIER] system

**Referenced text:** "Subcontractors/[SUPPLIER] Personnel.  [SUPPLIER] shall identify in writing any third party retained by [SUPPLIER] for, or assisting [SUPPLIER] in, the provision or support of the [SUPPLIER] IP prior to providing such third party with access to [CUSTOMER] Confidential Information (defined in Exhibit 2)."

---

### Comment 4

> For [SUPPLIER]:  They own any IP in any outputs from the system - I think that aligns with your model, but please let me know if they can only use the outputs during the term of the Trial licence.

**Referenced text:** "RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.  [CUSTOMER] acknowledges and agrees that, subject to [CUSTOMER]’s rights herein, [SUPPLIER] retains all right, title and interest, including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the [SUPPLIER] IP.  [SUPPLIER] acknowledges and agrees that, subject to [SUPPLIER]’s rights herein, [CUSTOMER] retains all right, title and interest, including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to any items and materials it (directly or indirectly) provides to [SUPPLIER], inputs into the [SUPPLIER]’s service or which [SUPPLIER] otherwise collects or generates (including as an output) on behalf [CUSTOMER] (“NBCU Data”). [SUPPLIER] may use such items and materials solely for the purpose of performing its obligations to [CUSTOMER] under this Trial and shall not, nor permit any person or entity to, copy, use or disclose NBCU Data to develop, train or improve any automated tool or device without [CUSTOMER]’s prior written approval."

---

### Comment 5

> For [SUPPLIER]: I have chosen these clauses from Exhibit 3 which probably map onto your existing processes.

**Referenced text:** "clauses 6 (Data Retention and Descruction), 8 (Cyber Security Incidents) and 9 (Application and Software Requirements)"

---

### Comment 6

> For [SUPPLIER]: See my comment above re: warranties. Standard warranties to go with software licensing.  I would normally delete these for trial agreement and go with “as is”.

**Referenced text:** "[SUPPLIER] hereby represents, warrants and covenants to [CUSTOMER] as follows: (i) it has all necessary authority to execute this Trial, to license the [SUPPLIER] IP and to provide any related implementation services; (ii) the use or exploitation of any [SUPPLIER] IP (and related implementation services including the generation and use of outputs, including those generated by automated means) or [SUPPLIER] Confidential Information by [CUSTOMER] does not and will not infringe, or constitute an infringement or misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights or applicable terms of a third party and does not and will not entitle any third party to make a claim against [CUSTOMER] for the unlawful use of confidential information;"

---

### Comment 7

> For [SUPPLIER]: Note this warranty that you have inserted protections against bias

**Referenced text:** "); (iv) [SUPPLIER] has not trained its models or services to be biased or discriminatory and has taken reasonable steps to mitigate biased and discrimination in its model and any outputs; and (v)"

---

### Comment 8

> For [SUPPLIER]:  See comments above re: warranties. The IPR / bias / virus indemnity only applies to claims from third parties, so is limited.  But n.b. The confidentiality and security indemnity covers all breaches.

**Referenced text:** "INDEMNIFICATION.  [SUPPLIER] shall indemnify, defend, and hold [CUSTOMER] and each of its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, damages, judgments, settlements and expenses of every kind and nature (including attorneys’ and experts’ fees, penalties and interest) and will reimburse such as they are incurred arising from (i) a third party claim arising from or related to an alleged breach of clause 9.0; or (ii) its alleged breach of Section 7.0 or 8.0 or a compromise of [CUSTOMER]’s Confidential Information."

---

### Comment 9

> For [SUPPLIER]: N.b. no publicity

**Referenced text:** "No Publicity.  Each Party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the other Party use the other Party’s name or trademark in a press release or for the purposes of advertising publicity or other public announcement."

---

### Comment 10

> For [SUPPLIER]: As per our emails, I am advising as if this was UK law

**Referenced text:** "accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflicts of laws and principles thereof. The Parties hereby submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located within the County of New York,"

---

### Comment 11

> For [SUPPLIER]: If you keep this high-level that benefits you in the warranty/indemnity earlier on

---

### Comment 12

> For [SUPPLIER]: Please review this carefully - add details of any third parties involved, and correct any statements which are inaccurate.  E.g. is it correct to say that you control the training data?  And that no [CUSTOMER] Data will be used to train it?

---

### Comment 13

> For [SUPPLIER]: Looks ok

**Referenced text:** "Exhibit 2"
