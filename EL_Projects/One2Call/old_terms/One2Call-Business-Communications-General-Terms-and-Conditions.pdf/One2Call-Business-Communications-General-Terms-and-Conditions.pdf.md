   THE SERVICES AND USE OF THE SERVICES

1.Provision of the Services

   1.1 The Services we supply to you are those Services which

   (a) you have ordered by telephone and are set out in the Service Agreement and Order Schedules attached to these Conditions confirming your order, or (b) you have elected to receive as set out in the Service Agreement and Order Schedules, or (c) have been ordered via our website on your behalf by a third party (details of such Services will be set out in a letter to you from us) and which you have subsequently confirmed that you wish to receive, or (d) which you have subsequently ordered in writing, by fax, by email or by telephone, and in each case which we have agreed in writing or by email to supply to you.  These may include (but are not limited to):

   **** The ability to make or receive a Call (telephone service);

   **** The provision of a Line or Lines for a rental charge (line rental service);

   **** The provision of Broadband internet access (Broadband service);

   **** The provision of Inbound telephony services (Inbound service);

   **** The provision of Mobile telephony services (Mobile service);

   **** The provision of IP telephony services (IPT service);

   **** The provision of Data services (Data service);

   **** Any other Services which we may offer for sale from time to time.

   For the avoidance of doubt, you may not resell the Services although they may be utilised by an Associated Company of yours for which use you shall remain fully liable.

   1.1.1 Your agreement with us starts on the date on the signed Service Agreement and your contract commencement date (the “Contract Commencement Date”) will be the date on the signed Service Agreement or the date each Service is first made available to you for use, whichever is the latest.  You accept that this may mean you will have multiple Contract Commencement Dates however each Contract Commencement Date will be subject to the Minimum Term.

   Where you are not currently in a contract we may notify you of a change to these Conditions, by giving you at least 30 days notice in accordance with 19.2, then your new Contract Commencement Date will be the date the new Conditions came into effect.  Where there may be any conflict regarding your Contract Commencement Date, then you agree the actual Contract Commencement Date will be the date you first used the Service(s) other than where we have given notice of a change to these Conditions.

   1.1.2 All Services allow access to UK emergency services and caller location information (when based in the UK) unless specifically advised otherwise within this Agreement. Such access may be subject to the availability of a power supply to the line and alternative arrangements are your responsibility in the event of a power failure.

   1.2 We will use reasonable endeavours to provide you with the Services by the date(s) we agree with you and to continue to provide the Services until this Agreement is terminated.  However we will not be liable for any loss or damages should the Services not commence or restart on the agreed date.  All

   Date: 22/11/2017

   Services will be provided in accordance with our Customer Service Plan.

   1.3 In providing the Services we shall use the reasonable skill and care that may be expected from a competent communications service provider.

   1.4 Broadband service:

   **(a)** If we consider that your bandwidth usage profile is abnormal or out of the ordinary (including without limitation extremely high levels of bandwidth use in a given period), we have the right to take such action as we deem appropriate which may include, without limitation, restricting or suspending your use of the broadband service, or increasing the charges you pay for the broadband service in accordance with paragraph 19.2.

   **(b)** We will make reasonable endeavours to inform you in advance if we impose any restrictions on your use of the broadband service.

   **(c)** Your use of the broadband service is entirely at your own risk. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any virus, Trojan horse, spam or other malicious content that you may receive while using the broadband service notwithstanding that there may be a firewall contained in equipment supplied in connection with the broadband service. (d) To ensure the quality of our broadband service we have a traffic prioritisation process to prioritise business critical applications in the event of exceptional demand, and normally only during business hours 08.00 to 18.00 Monday to Friday. However, it is unlikely that this will impact the quality of your broadband service.

      1.5 Outbound service:

   **(a)** All calls are to be routed over our chosen network. Should any calls be routed over any other network with or without your knowledge, other than during a service failure or network outage that we have notified you of or for any other reason we may agree with you, then we reserve the right to bill you at our standard tariff (available on request).

   **(b)** Where you use a call forwarding feature on any of our Services, you agree and accept that such forwarded calls will be chargeable at the rate applicable on your tariff at the time.

      1.6 Inbound service:

   **(a)** We reserve the right to apply a monthly charge for each inbound number which does not carry any traffic for any period of 3 consecutive months.  Where this charge has been applied and a number subsequently carries traffic in any month then this charge will not apply to the months where there is traffic.

   **(b)** We reserve the right to apply a nominal monthly charge for each inbound number where the only Service you take from us is the Inbound Service.

   **(c)** If an inbound number is withdrawn by Ofcom or PhonepayPlus or any of our suppliers for reasons beyond our control we reserve the right to recover the number(s) from you immediately. We will use our reasonable endeavours to supply you with another number which is acceptable to you. (d) Where you take an international number as part of the Inbound Service, in addition to the above, the following shall apply:

   **(i)** we cannot guarantee call quality and shall not be liable forservice incompatibility.  It is recommended that you perform full compatibility tests prior to publishing any international number(s) provided by us;

   **(ii)** we cannot guarantee support for calls from mobile numbersunless otherwise specified and in these cases there will be an additional charge;

   **(iii)** you accept that restrictions to the service may apply incertain countries;

      (iii) we are reliant on third parties for delivery of your billable call records so there may be a delay in us billing your for your international inbound calls, there will be no time limit on us billing you for these calls.  In some cases calls will be logged in two parts and we may bill these parts in different months, but endeavor to do this within two concurrent months.

      1.7 IPT Service:

      If you have an IPT Service and move location, it is your responsibility to update your address details either using the portal or by notifying us of any change in address where the relevant equipment will be housed so that the correct information can be supplied for Emergency Authority purposes.

      1.8.3 You agree that some Services variants may be subject to availability and where an ordered Service is not available for any reason we reserve the right to provide an alternative Service variant for which you may incur different charges.  Where a Service variant is not available we will make best endeavours to advise you of this before progressing with your order.

      1.9 Services with Call Recording:

      Where you take a service which includes call recording of inbound and/or outbound calls you confirm that you have received and read our Call Recording Legal Requirements Guidance document and acknowledge that the information should not be relied upon in isolation and hereby accept that it is your responsibility to obtain legal advice to ensure you are fully compliant before recording any calls.  You further confirm that you will comply with all legal requirements when using any call recording product and agree that One2Call Ltd shall have no liability for any costs or claims which may be incurred as a result of any failure by you to comply with any legal requirements whether or not you were aware of the requirement.

   **9.** Data protection and use of your information 9.1 All information that we hold concerning you as an individual (“Personal Data”) will be held and processed by us strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Such data will be used by us to provide you with the Services, for related purposes and for the purposes set out in paragraph 9.2.

      YOUR OBLIGATIONS

10.Paying our charges for the Services

   10.1 Charges

      You must pay the charges for the Services according to the applicable Tariff(s). This applies whether you or someone else use the Services and whether the Services are used with your full knowledge and consent or otherwise. (This means by way of example but not by way of limitation that you are liable to pay for all calls made as a result of “rogue diallers”, unbarred premium rate numbers and calls made by any third party gaining unauthorised access to your telephony systems).  We may vary the charges set out in the Tariff as explained in paragraph 19.2.

   10.2 Installation and Connection charges

      The Service Agreement, Order Schedules and Tariff(s) set out whether installation costs are payable for the Services we have agreed to supply to you. However, we may be unable (due to third party constraints) to tell you when you place, or we confirm, your order for the Services how much these installation costs will be.  If this is the case, we will give you an estimate of how much the installation costs will be prior to commencement of the installation work, but there may be supplementary excess construction charges. You agree to pay all installation costs actually incurred.  In the event of an installation being cancelled before being completed you agree to pay all of the installation costs actually incurred to the point of cancellation which will be notified to you at the time.

   10.3 Equipment

      You must pay the charges for any Sale Equipment that we supply to you. We will invoice you for the Sale Equipment in the next invoice that we send to you (in accordance with paragraph 10.4) following the date on which we dispatch the Sale Equipment to you. You shall also pay the rental charges for any Rental Equipment that we supply to you, and we shall invoice you for this on a monthly basis in accordance with paragraph 10.4.

   10.4 Invoices

      We will send you your first invoice at the beginning of the month after the Services commence and thereafter on a monthly basis, but we shall be entitled to send you an invoice at a different time, which you shall pay in each case in accordance with paragraph 10.7.  We will send all invoices and other correspondence to the address set out in the Service Agreement or otherwise the address you ask us to. We will show on the invoice which charges are payable in advance or in arrears, as referred to in paragraph 10.5. We will include all charges on the next invoice where possible, and in any event as soon as we can.  Invoices shall be deemed to have been accepted by you if you do not present a written objection, identifying clearly the disputed invoice and the reasons why it is challenged, to us within six (6) months of the date of the invoice. If such objection is made we shall both make all reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute promptly.  Provided you comply with these requirements in presenting your objection, if we fail to respond to that objection within thirty (30) days after its receipt by us, the objection will be deemed to have been accepted by us. We will accordingly amend the relevant invoice either with an appropriate credit to you or you shall be liable to pay the balance (if any) of the amended invoice within seven (7) days of its receipt by you.

   10.5 Rental and Call charges

      You will incur charges from the time any part of a Service is used or received except in the case of Services subject to a periodic rental, in which case you will incur charges from the date the Service is made available for use. We will usually ask you to pay the rental in advance and your first invoice will include both one month’s rental in advance and a charge for a part month’s rental from the Contract Commencement Date up to the beginning of the first complete month, where appropriate, and then monthly in advance thereafter.  Call and other charges will be invoiced in arrears.  We will calculate the charges for Calls using the details recorded by our network.

      10.6 Payments in advance and deposits (a) We may ask you for a payment in advance before payment would normally be due, which you shall pay in accordance with paragraph 10.7. This advance payment will not be more than our best estimate of your following month’s invoice.  Should your advance payment exceed your actual invoice then any surplus will be credited to your account to be offset against subsequent invoices, should there be no further invoices and your account is not in debit then we will refund to you any surplus after deducting any cancellation or termination charges.

      (b) We may ask for a deposit at any time, as security for payment of your invoices if it is reasonable for us to do so, which you shall pay in accordance with paragraph 10.7.  Our procedures for deposits will be explained to you at the relevant time.

   10.7 Terms of payment

      Our standard credit terms are payment within fourteen (14) days of date of invoice by direct debit and these are the credit terms which will apply to this Agreement unless we have agreed otherwise in writing. You must pay all charges and rental within the credit terms which we have agreed and any advance payments and deposits when we ask for them.  We reserve the right to apply a nominal monthly charge for non direct debit payment methods.  Where payment is arranged through a finance provider payment shall be in accordance with the terms of the finance agreement.  Unless otherwise stated all charges exclude VAT which is chargeable at the applicable rate. If you pay us from a non UK bank account which means we incur costs for receiving international payments, then we shall pass these costs on to you.

   10.8  Tariff

      **(a)** You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have agreed to supply the Services to you at the agreed Tariff and charges on the basis that you have committed to the Minimum Spend and Minimum Term commitments.

      **(b)** Our call rates for outbound calls to UK non geographic numbers are charged according to the banding used by BT. You hereby acknowledge and agree that there may be occasions where a call type moves from one band to another band or BT change their charging structure and subsequently the charges for some of these call types may change, we will apply this change from the 1st of the month following the change and you acknowledge that we may not always be able to give you notice of such changes.

      **(c)** Where you take any bundled service you agree to pay for all chargeable items which are excluded from or exceed the allowance of the bundle.

      **(d)** Unless otherwise agreed with you in writing all call costs in our Tariff are displayed in pence per minute.  All billing is per second, call durations are measured up to the whole second and the call charges rounded up to a penny.

      **(e)** Inbound bundles include calls which terminate to landlines only, unless specified otherwise in writing.  Should you terminate your calls to a mobile, a non-geographic or an international number then standard call charges will apply and are available on request.

      **(f)** You accept there may be charges for elements of a Service (such as additional features, regrades, moves or ceases) that you may incur which may not be detailed in your Service Agreement but you accept responsibility for these charges should they occur.

   10.9 Finance and Credit

      10.9.1 You hereby consent to and shall procure that your owners, directors, officers and assigns consent to, us carrying out searches with credit reference agencies relating to the credit worthiness of your Company and/or your owners, directors, officers and assigns and you undertake to supply or procure the supply of all information requested for a credit search with a credit reference agency, who will add to your records and/or those records of your directors, officers and assigns details of the searches and these will be seen by other organisations that make searches.

      10.9.2 It is agreed that where we approach a finance provider to arrange finance for the purchase of Equipment then we are acting as an agent for the Customer and not for the finance provider.

      10.9.3 In the event that we are unable to obtain finance on the terms originally proposed or on other terms acceptable to you then we shall return any deposit received from you without further liability to you.  Where third party indemnities are required by the finance provider failure to provide such indemnities shall constitute a breach of these Conditions and shall entitle us to retain any deposit paid by you.

      10.9.4 After delivery and installation (where applicable) is completed any failure by you to complete the finance agreement documentation and/or commence payment in accordance with the terms of the finance agreement shall render you liable to pay to us the full value of the order (plus VAT) within seven (7) days of presentation of an invoice.

   10.10 Inbound Rebates

      We reserve the right to offset any inbound rebates which may be due to you against any amounts you may owe to us.  We reserve the right not to pay any inbound rebates until such rebates total a cumulative minimum of £5 in any month.

   10.11 Offsetting

      Where we owe you any monies, you agree that we may offset this against any monies you may owe us before we make any payment to you.

   10.12 Online Orders and Payments

      Where you place an order and make a payment online for that order and we accept your order, we will confirm your order and receipt of payment by email at which point your contract will be binding.  You may also get a payment confirmation from the third party payment processing company. Where we do not accept your order we reserve the right to return a payment to you.  You should contact us immediately if you have any concerns regarding the order or payment.  Where you fail to advise us of any issues regarding your online payment we are not liable for any consequences of any such payment but will make reasonable endeavours to rectify any of your concerns.

   10.13 Trial Periods

      Where you take a product or service on a trial basis for a full, reduced or zero charge for a fixed period, unless otherwise advised to you in writing, you need to give us notice in writing if you wish to cancel the Service at the end of the trial.  If you fail to give us notice then we will automatically invoice you for the product or service at the end of the trial for the remainder of the agreed contract term (or where there is no agreed term, for a minimum of twelve months).  For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise agreed in writing you will be liable for all usage charges during the trial period.  Should you wish to cancel after the trial then you agree to return, at your own cost, any equipment to us in full working order.

   10.14 Other Charges

      We reserve the right to make a nominal monthly charge for paper itemised billing; our basic online billing is provided as standard to all customers free of charge.  We also reserve the right to apply a £20 per month minimum charge if your monthly invoice would be less than £20.

   10.15 Credit Limit

      We may apply a credit limit to your account and if you exceed this credit limit we reserve the right to suspend Services until you have paid a deposit.

   10.16 Unusual Call Profile

      **(b)** If we need someone else's permission to cross, or put our equipment in, or make an installation on their premises, you must get that permission for us and make any necessary arrangements.

You also agree not to make any deduction from any monies owed to us as a result of any dispute you may have with any such third party.

      Where your lines are transferred to us on a like for like basis, you agree to pay for any additional services which may exist on your lines that you may not have made us aware of at the time of ordering regardless of when these services are billed to us by the underlying supplier (including but not limited to telephone book entries that may be billed to us annually by BT).

It is your responsibility to advise us if you receive invoices from other providers for services you believe to be with us and you should advise us as soon as you receive these invoices.  We shall not be liable for any loss or damages as a result of you being invoiced by other providers (including but not limited to any perceived loss of savings).

   11.7 Existing Contractual Obligations

      It is your responsibility to ensure that signing a contract with us does not breach any existing contractual obligations you may have with any other suppliers and you should give any other suppliers notice as may be required by them.  We are not responsible or liable for any costs, financial losses or disputes that may arise from any such breach of contract or your failure to give the correct notice.

   11.8 Resilience

      It is your responsibility to ensure you have adequate resilience in place to protect against any loss of data, service or connectivity; this includes a separate power supply for IPT phones.  In accordance with paragraph 13.2, we will not be liable for any loss or damage (financial or otherwise) where you fail to do so.

      REPAIRING FAULTS

12.Repairing faults

   12.1 We will investigate any fault that is reported to us according to our standard procedures for the Service in question (which are available on request). We will use reasonable endeavours to repair any fault that is reported to us and which is directly caused by us or our employees or agents according to our standard procedures for the Service in question. 12.2 When we agree to work on a fault outside the hours covered by our standard procedures, you will be liable to pay us an extra charge at the applicable rate set out in our tariffs in force at the time.

   12.3 If you tell us there is a fault in a Service and we find either that there is not or that you, someone at your premises or a third party (including, without limitation, another network operator or communications supplier) has caused the fault or the interruption in service, we may charge you for any work we have done to try to find the fault or to repair it. We are not liable for any loss or damages arising from a fault or interruption in service caused by someone other than us, and we are not responsible for fixing any faults not caused by us.

   12.4 During any fault investigations, we may require you to carry out tests and we will require you to feedback any results of these tests to allow us to follow our standard procedures and conclude our investigations.

   12.5 Where Call routing utilises IP, you acknowledge that call quality and availability can be subject to factors outside of our control e.g. bandwidth contention or quality of service (QoS). We shall not be liable to you in respect to any quality or availability issues with such a Service.

   12.6 Where a fault reported is deemed to be caused by a router provided by One2Call Ltd, we will replace this as long as the current router is within its warranty period. We will ship a new router to you as soon as possible, preconfigured with the username and password and any IP Addressing requested on the original order. At this point a charge for the new router will be raised and only credited back on receipt of the original faulty router.  If the router is outside of the 12 month warranty period, the new router is chargeable and will show on the next invoice.

   16.1 If you are a domestic user, you may cancel the Services or an individual Service without giving any reason at any time up to fourteen (14) calendar days after either the date on which you accepted these Conditions (and the Service Agreement and other documents comprising this Agreement) or, if earlier, the date on which we commenced our supply of the Services to you, provided that you notify us clearly in writing of such cancellation within such period and return any equipment that we may have sent to you, undamaged and in its original packaging by sending it special delivery to us at Unit 16, Venture One Business Park, Longacre Close, Sheffield, S20 3FR. You will be deemed to have accepted these Conditions at the time you sign our Service Agreement and Order Schedule.

If you cancel the Services or an individual Service, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery of any equipment (except for the supplementary costs arising if you choose a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), and we will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction but in any event you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement. No cancellation charge or other charge will be payable for the Services although if you do not return any equipment that we may have sent to you, we shall be entitled to charge you or withhold reimbursement for the costs we incur in collecting it from you. This does not affect your statutory rights. For the avoidance of doubt, this cancellation right does not apply to business users.

18.Minimum Term, Minimum Spend and Contract Renewal

   18.1 The Minimum Term and Minimum Spend will be as specified on the Service Agreement, Order Schedules or Tariff(s) for each Service, or as otherwise agreed with you in writing.  In the event that the Minimum Term is not on the Service Agreement or Order Schedules then the Minimum Term will be 12 months from your Contract Commencement Date.  In the event that the Minimum Spend is not on the Service Agreement or Order Schedules then the Minimum Spend applicable will be the sum of any fixed rental charges plus the value of your call usage on your second bill from One2Call.  The Minimum Term for any new installation will be at least twelve (12) months or greater as may be specified in the Service Agreement or Order Form.

   18.2 If you fail to reach the annualised Minimum Spend commitment in respect of a Service over the initial Minimum Term and any renewal Minimum Term for such Service then we reserve the right to bill you the difference between the actual amount you spent and the amount you committed to spend pursuant to the Minimum Spend over the Minimum Term.

   18.4 After the expiry of the initial and each subsequent Minimum Term, unless otherwise agreed with you in writing, your contract will automatically renew for a further period of 12 months.  This automatic renewal reoccurs on each 12 month anniversary until the Agreement is terminated by either party by giving 30 days written notice to expire no earlier than the end of the then current Minimum Term in accordance with paragraph 17, subject to paragraph 15.  Such automatic contract renewal will be on the same terms and, unless otherwise agreed in writing, the same Minimum Spend will apply.

   Paragraph 18.4 shall not apply to you if:

   1) your business meets criteria as defined by Ofcom which would classify you as a residential or small business Customer unless you have opted in to the automatic contract renewal at the point of placing your order by ticking the applicable box on the Service Agreement.   For the avoidance of doubt, should you not tick this box and your company does not meet the Ofcom criteria which would classify your company as residential or small business then automatic contract renewal and paragraph 18.4 will apply.
