It draws on elements from application service provision agreements and also from outsourcing contracts. It is intended for use where the Supplier will provide a service consisting of the integrated management of personnel, equipment, materials, software and telecoms services and is most likely to be appropriate for medium-sized deals (that is, where the Customer will retain an in-house capability of its own, or where the managed service itself, whilst important to the Customer, is not, in and of itself, absolutely business critical).\n \nThe agreement can be used for telecoms infrastructure-sharing arrangements where the management of the infrastructure is outsourced. However, if the arrangement is simply to share equipment, such as base stations, this agreement will not be appropriate.\n \nOn more complex transactions, especially those where there will be a transfer of staff, where the Supplier will be undertaking a complex transition and then transformation programme, or where many jurisdictions and affiliates are involved, it will probably be necessary to add some additional provisions. For more information and resources that may be more appropriate for complex transactions, see the following Standard documents:\n \n and its integrated drafting notes.\n and its integrated drafting notes\n and its integrated drafting notes.\n \nDrafting assumptions\n \nThe document assumes that:\n \nWhile the terms are drafted slightly in favour of the supplier, the parties wish to conclude a reasonably balanced document. However, it should be noted that the following provisions are particularly customer friendly and therefore are unlikely to be acceptable to suppliers:\n (the requirement for due diligence should be subject to the information being provided by the Customer being complete and accurate);\n (suppliers generally try to resist indemnities for data breaches);\n (as a warranty this is particularly onerous on the Supplier. More usually, the Customer may seek a right to terminate in the event of disparagement of the Customer’s business. Further, in some cases, this right will be mutual);\n (in the current climate, it is unlikely that the Supplier would accept an automatic price reduction on an annual basis).\nIf this agreement is intended to be used in the financial services sector, or in the insurance (and reinsurance) industry, additional amendments may be required to ensure compliance with applicable regulation, see:\n.\n.\nThere will be an initial set-up phase consisting of the Supplier undertaking a due diligence exercise, after which there will be a transfer of assets, software and contracts to the Supplier.\nWhen acting for the Customer, it may be sensible to suggest separating these two phases so that an initial contract provides only for the due diligence exercise, at the end of which a detailed list (or map) of assets and infrastructure will be produced. This list can then be used to assist a procurement exercise for the second, full service, phase. It should be made clear whether the Customer is entitled to use the output of that first phase to procure the second phase from an alternative supplier.\nThere will be no transfer of staff.\nThese standard terms do not deal with any issues arising out of the  (TUPE). For more information about when TUPE may apply to service provision changes see .\nIt is difficult to prescribe a single approach to dealing with employees on commencement of the services and on exit for all situations. It is often advisable for the agreement to address TUPE on both entry and exit, even where it is not anticipated that TUPE will apply, in case the parties’ analysis of whether TUPE applies is incorrect or there is a change in law or interpretation during the term of the agreement; however this will depend on the particular circumstances and whether the agreement is to be supplier-friendly or customer-friendly.\nIf TUPE indemnities are provided on entry, the usual commercial approach is that these are mirrored on exit. Remaining silent on entry and exit and allowing TUPE to take its course may be beneficial to the party who is the transferor at that particular stage as all the liabilities would pass to the transferee. Therefore, it may be beneficial for a Customer to have no TUPE provisions on entry as generally employees and liabilities will pass to the Supplier, but the corollary is that the Customer will not have the benefit of TUPE indemnities on exit if the services are taken back in house or if it is asked to indemnify a replacement Supplier.\nIt is becoming more common to see a “blanket indemnity” on entry and exit under which the transferor indemnifies the transferee against all liabilities in relation to employees and employment-related liabilities that transfer under TUPE, so that if any employees transfer, the transferee can terminate their employment and the transferor will pick up all liabilities (provided that their employment is terminated within a finite period). Such indemnities are often requested where the transferee does not want to inherit any employees or where it is considered that TUPE will not apply to the provision of the services or the termination of the services.\nConsider including provisions such as those in where it is likely that TUPE will apply to transfer employees and a blanket indemnity as described above is not appropriate.\nBoth parties are companies based in the UK and the managed services will be performed in the UK.\nIf either party is a partnership (or LLP), individual or other non-corporate entity, amendments will be required, including to the insolvency triggers in  and address for notices in .\nThe provisions of this document reflect the current applicable law.\n \nOther clauses\n \nThe following provisions are not included in this standard document but may be considered in some situations:\n \nA minimum revenue guarantee may be relevant where there is an element of the services for which the fee is not fixed in advance.\nSuppliers sometimes offer a most-favoured customer clause, promising not to offer some of the services to other similarly situated customers for a lower price.\nA step-in provision would allow the Customer temporarily to take over the service (either directly itself or via a third party) if the Supplier is failing or is unable to provide the service itself. Step-in provisions are usually strongly resisted by the Supplier and, where they are agreed, there will usually be a lengthy series of steps to be taken before they can be invoked.\n \nSupply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking\n \nThe  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.\n \nThe Supplier should note that the Customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the Supplier will comply with the Customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies, too, such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the Supplier may require the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.\n \nFor further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .\n \nData protection\n \nWhere  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at  or, alternatively, as part of a data protection schedule to be annexed to this agreement.\n \nThe clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.\n \nFor some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:\n \n.\n.\nEach set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.\n \nFor a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .\n \nNetwork and Information Systems Regulations 2018\n \nThe  (NIS Regulations) came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the  (also known as the Network and Information Security or NIS Directive). They have potential impact on:\n \nAny operator of essential services (OES) that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure.\nRelevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).\nYou will need to assess whether your agreement is affected by the NIS Regulations, either directly, because the Customer falls within the scope of the NIS Regulations, or indirectly, because your agreement is further up a supply chain that includes an entity within the scope of those regulations.\n \nLike the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.\n \nThe banking and financial market infrastructures sectors were omitted from the NIS Regulations although they fall within the Cybersecurity Directive. The UK government stated in its consultation on implementation of the Directive that competent authorities for these sectors would not be identified. Firms and financial market infrastructure within these sectors must continue to adhere to requirements and standards as set by the Bank of England and/or the Financial Conduct Authority.\n \nFor a definition of an OES, see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .\n \nOESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OESs). If the Customer is an OES or a RDSP, the Supplier’s system, and the managed services being provided under this agreement, might be implicated in their obligations under the NIS Regulations.\n \nThe National Cyber Security Centre has published  for OESs which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances.\n \nThe Customer should also refer to any specific guidance issued by the regulator for the specific OES sector or by the ICO for RDSPs and any applicable guidance for the banking and financial market infrastructures sectors.\n \nWe have included what we consider to be reasonably balanced cybersecurity and business continuity obligations as part of , which may be prudent for the parties to include even when the NIS Regulations are not formally engaged. For more extensive cybersecurity provisions see .\n  \nDrafting for Brexit\n \nOn 31 January 2020 (), the UK left the EU and the UK-EU withdrawal agreement entered into force. Following the end of the  at 11.00 pm UK time on 31 December 2020,  was created, the remaining withdrawal agreement provisions came into operation, and the  (including the UK-EU trade and co-operation agreement) started to apply on a provisional basis, eventually entering into force at 11.00 pm (UK time) on 30 April 2021.

In summary, the Supplier has an obligation to prepare and then implement a project plan with the Customer. Before beginning the managed service, there will be a transfer of equipment, Third-Party Software, Customer Software and other intellectual property to the Supplier. This agreement assumes that this transfer will be made for a nominal consideration since, even though these assets will have some value, this will be factored in to the overall commercial deal (including the set-up fees). The Customer excludes any warranties in respect of the assets transferred.\n \nIf acting for the Customer, the following points should be considered.\n \n \nKey personnel: clause 3.1\n \nIn addition to listing the individuals who form part of the Supplier Account Team, the Customer may want to specify a number of key personnel who are critical to the provision of the services performed under the agreement and who cannot be replaced without the Customer’s prior written consent (except if, for example, they resign or are promoted and so on).\n \nProject Manager: clause 3.2\n \nThe Supplier is required to ensure the continuity of the Supplier’s Project Manager but has the right to replace them from time to time. A Customer may want a degree of control over the Supplier’s appointment of a replacement Project Manager.\n \nKey dates: clause 3.3\n \nThe Supplier must perform the services in accordance with the timetables set out in  of , but the dates set out are estimates only. A Customer should consider binding the Supplier to hit key dates and making “time of the essence”, perhaps with an obligation on the Supplier to pay liquidated damages to the Customer in the event of failure to achieve any such key dates. The period for performance should be extended, or any liquidated damages reduced, where the Customer has contributed to the delay, otherwise the Supplier will have a defence to any claim for liquidated damages in these circumstances even if the delay is also due to the Supplier.\n \nRight to terminate following inability to correct errors: clause 3.5\n \nUnder this clause, either party can terminate the agreement if the Supplier is unable to correct any Error after three attempts.
