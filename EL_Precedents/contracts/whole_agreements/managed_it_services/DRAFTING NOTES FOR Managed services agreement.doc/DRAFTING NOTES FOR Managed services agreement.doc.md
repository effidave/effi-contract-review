# DRAFTING NOTES FOR Managed services agreement

by  and Mimi Curran, Deloitte Legal

Standard documents | Maintained | England

An agreement that is intended for use where the supplier will provide a service consisting of the integrated management of personnel, equipment, materials, software and telecoms services. It is drafted slightly in favour of the supplier, but is nevertheless a reasonably balanced document.

General document notes
 
This managed services agreement is drafted slightly in favour of the Supplier. It draws on elements from application service provision agreements and also from outsourcing contracts. It is intended for use where the Supplier will provide a service consisting of the integrated management of personnel, equipment, materials, software and telecoms services and is most likely to be appropriate for medium-sized deals (that is, where the Customer will retain an in-house capability of its own, or where the managed service itself, whilst important to the Customer, is not, in and of itself, absolutely business critical).
 
The agreement can be used for telecoms infrastructure-sharing arrangements where the management of the infrastructure is outsourced. However, if the arrangement is simply to share equipment, such as base stations, this agreement will not be appropriate.
 
On more complex transactions, especially those where there will be a transfer of staff, where the Supplier will be undertaking a complex transition and then transformation programme, or where many jurisdictions and affiliates are involved, it will probably be necessary to add some additional provisions. For more information and resources that may be more appropriate for complex transactions, see the following Standard documents:
 
 and its integrated drafting notes.
 and its integrated drafting notes
 and its integrated drafting notes.
 
Drafting assumptions
 
The document assumes that:
 
While the terms are drafted slightly in favour of the supplier, the parties wish to conclude a reasonably balanced document. However, it should be noted that the following provisions are particularly customer friendly and therefore are unlikely to be acceptable to suppliers:
 (the requirement for due diligence should be subject to the information being provided by the Customer being complete and accurate);
 (suppliers generally try to resist indemnities for data breaches);
 (as a warranty this is particularly onerous on the Supplier. More usually, the Customer may seek a right to terminate in the event of disparagement of the Customer’s business. Further, in some cases, this right will be mutual);
 (in the current climate, it is unlikely that the Supplier would accept an automatic price reduction on an annual basis).
If this agreement is intended to be used in the financial services sector, or in the insurance (and reinsurance) industry, additional amendments may be required to ensure compliance with applicable regulation, see:
.
.
There will be an initial set-up phase consisting of the Supplier undertaking a due diligence exercise, after which there will be a transfer of assets, software and contracts to the Supplier.
When acting for the Customer, it may be sensible to suggest separating these two phases so that an initial contract provides only for the due diligence exercise, at the end of which a detailed list (or map) of assets and infrastructure will be produced. This list can then be used to assist a procurement exercise for the second, full service, phase. It should be made clear whether the Customer is entitled to use the output of that first phase to procure the second phase from an alternative supplier.
There will be no transfer of staff.
These standard terms do not deal with any issues arising out of the  (TUPE). For more information about when TUPE may apply to service provision changes see .
It is difficult to prescribe a single approach to dealing with employees on commencement of the services and on exit for all situations. It is often advisable for the agreement to address TUPE on both entry and exit, even where it is not anticipated that TUPE will apply, in case the parties’ analysis of whether TUPE applies is incorrect or there is a change in law or interpretation during the term of the agreement; however this will depend on the particular circumstances and whether the agreement is to be supplier-friendly or customer-friendly.
If TUPE indemnities are provided on entry, the usual commercial approach is that these are mirrored on exit. Remaining silent on entry and exit and allowing TUPE to take its course may be beneficial to the party who is the transferor at that particular stage as all the liabilities would pass to the transferee. Therefore, it may be beneficial for a Customer to have no TUPE provisions on entry as generally employees and liabilities will pass to the Supplier, but the corollary is that the Customer will not have the benefit of TUPE indemnities on exit if the services are taken back in house or if it is asked to indemnify a replacement Supplier.
It is becoming more common to see a “blanket indemnity” on entry and exit under which the transferor indemnifies the transferee against all liabilities in relation to employees and employment-related liabilities that transfer under TUPE, so that if any employees transfer, the transferee can terminate their employment and the transferor will pick up all liabilities (provided that their employment is terminated within a finite period). Such indemnities are often requested where the transferee does not want to inherit any employees or where it is considered that TUPE will not apply to the provision of the services or the termination of the services.
Consider including provisions such as those in where it is likely that TUPE will apply to transfer employees and a blanket indemnity as described above is not appropriate.
Both parties are companies based in the UK and the managed services will be performed in the UK.
If either party is a partnership (or LLP), individual or other non-corporate entity, amendments will be required, including to the insolvency triggers in  and address for notices in .
The provisions of this document reflect the current applicable law.
 
Other clauses
 
The following provisions are not included in this standard document but may be considered in some situations:
 
A minimum revenue guarantee may be relevant where there is an element of the services for which the fee is not fixed in advance.
Suppliers sometimes offer a most-favoured customer clause, promising not to offer some of the services to other similarly situated customers for a lower price.
A step-in provision would allow the Customer temporarily to take over the service (either directly itself or via a third party) if the Supplier is failing or is unable to provide the service itself. Step-in provisions are usually strongly resisted by the Supplier and, where they are agreed, there will usually be a lengthy series of steps to be taken before they can be invoked.
 
Supply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking
 
The  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.
 
The Supplier should note that the Customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the Supplier will comply with the Customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies, too, such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the Supplier may require the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.
 
For further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .
 
Data protection
 
Where  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at  or, alternatively, as part of a data protection schedule to be annexed to this agreement.
 
The clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.
 
For some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:
 
.

Each set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.
 
For a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .
 
Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018
 
The  (NIS Regulations) came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the  (also known as the Network and Information Security or NIS Directive). They have potential impact on:
 
Any operator of essential services (OES) that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure.
Relevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).
You will need to assess whether your agreement is affected by the NIS Regulations, either directly, because the Customer falls within the scope of the NIS Regulations, or indirectly, because your agreement is further up a supply chain that includes an entity within the scope of those regulations.
 
Like the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.
 
The banking and financial market infrastructures sectors were omitted from the NIS Regulations although they fall within the Cybersecurity Directive. The UK government stated in its consultation on implementation of the Directive that competent authorities for these sectors would not be identified. Firms and financial market infrastructure within these sectors must continue to adhere to requirements and standards as set by the Bank of England and/or the Financial Conduct Authority.
 
For a definition of an OES, see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .
 
OESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OESs). If the Customer is an OES or a RDSP, the Supplier’s system, and the managed services being provided under this agreement, might be implicated in their obligations under the NIS Regulations.
 
The National Cyber Security Centre has published  for OESs which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances.
 
The Customer should also refer to any specific guidance issued by the regulator for the specific OES sector or by the ICO for RDSPs and any applicable guidance for the banking and financial market infrastructures sectors.
 
We have included what we consider to be reasonably balanced cybersecurity and business continuity obligations as part of , which may be prudent for the parties to include even when the NIS Regulations are not formally engaged. For more extensive cybersecurity provisions see .
  
Drafting for Brexit
 
On 31 January 2020 (), the UK left the EU and the UK-EU withdrawal agreement entered into force. Following the end of the  at 11.00 pm UK time on 31 December 2020,  was created, the remaining withdrawal agreement provisions came into operation, and the  (including the UK-EU trade and co-operation agreement) started to apply on a provisional basis, eventually entering into force at 11.00 pm (UK time) on 30 April 2021. This resource has been reviewed and reflects the position from the end of the transition period.

   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
The definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is used in . If acting for the Supplier, exclude this definition and the optional text in  that refers to this defined term in your initial draft.
 
Since 2012, UK accounting standards have been issued by the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC); before that date, standards were issued by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) or the ASB’s own predecessors; standards developed by the ASB are included in FRSs (Financial Reporting Standards), but only some of the SSAPs developed by the ASB’s predecessors have been superseded by FRSs.
 
International Accounting Standards (IAS) were issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee from 1973 to 2000. In 2001 this committee was replaced by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which adopted all the International Accounting Standards; some IASs have subsequently been amended or replaced by IFRSs, and the IASs are now collectively referred to as IFRSs even though individual IASs have not been renamed. The IFRS Interpretations Committee develops interpretations of IASs and IFRSs.
 
EU Regulation 1606/2002 (as amended) sets out a process for adopting “international accounting standards” which it defines as “International Accounting Standards (IAS), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related Interpretations (SIC-IFRIC interpretations), subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)”. A further regulation is required actually to adopt any particular standard.
 
Which accounting standards will apply will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: the type and size of the entity, the location and jurisdiction of the entity, and the reporting period for the entity. In the UK the latest rules and standards are set out in FRS 100, FRS 101, FRS 102, FRS 103, FRS 104 and FRS 105.

   2.  [SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND DUE DILIGENCE

   Service requirements and due diligence (optional clause)
 
This clause should be included in the agreement if acting for the Customer. It is a useful clause for:
 
Tying the Supplier in to the commitments set out in the Customer’s request for proposal document.
Obliging the Supplier to use its skill and experience in dealing with the Customer to elicit all the information it needs to be able to meet the Customer’s service requirements and provide the Services in accordance with the agreement.
This is a customer friendly provision. In particular, in relation to  the Supplier may seek to qualify the obligations imposed on it by either an assumption or a dependency that the information provided by the Customer is accurate and correct.

   2.1  [The Supplier warrants and represents that:

   (a)  when producing the Managed Services Specification it has taken account of and effectively incorporated all elements of the Service Requirements; and

   (b)  it is able to provide all of the Managed Services described in the Managed Services Specification in accordance with all applicable descriptions, as further set out and described in the Service Requirements,

   and the Supplier acknowledges that the Customer is entering into this agreement in reliance on the warranties and representations provided by the Supplier in this .]

   2.2  [The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the Effective Date:

   (a)  it has had an opportunity to carry out a thorough due diligence exercise in relation to the Service Requirements and has asked the Customer all the questions it considers to be relevant for the purpose of establishing whether it is able to provide the Services in accordance with the terms of this agreement;

   (b)  it has received all information necessary to enable it to determine whether it is able to provide the Services in accordance with the terms of this agreement;

   (c)  it has made its own enquiries to satisfy itself as to the accuracy and adequacy of any information supplied to it by or on behalf of the Customer and has raised all relevant due diligence questions with the Customer before entering into this agreement; and

   (d)  it has entered into this agreement solely in reliance on its own due diligence.]

   2.3  [In addition, throughout the term of this agreement, the Supplier shall be responsible for specifying to the Customer all information reasonably required by the Supplier for the purposes of recommending, advising, establishing, setting-up and providing the Services and the Supplier shall do so in sufficient detail to enable the Customer to supply all such information to the Supplier, so far as it is available to the Customer. The Supplier shall review all such information supplied by the Customer to the Supplier promptly on receipt and shall promptly following receipt notify the Customer of any further information reasonably required by the Supplier.]]

   3.  SET-UP SERVICES

   Set-up Services
 
 deals with the initial phase of service consisting of the steps set out in . In summary, the Supplier has an obligation to prepare and then implement a project plan with the Customer. Before beginning the managed service, there will be a transfer of equipment, Third-Party Software, Customer Software and other intellectual property to the Supplier. This agreement assumes that this transfer will be made for a nominal consideration since, even though these assets will have some value, this will be factored in to the overall commercial deal (including the set-up fees). The Customer excludes any warranties in respect of the assets transferred.
 
If acting for the Customer, the following points should be considered.
 
 
Key personnel: clause 3.1
 
In addition to listing the individuals who form part of the Supplier Account Team, the Customer may want to specify a number of key personnel who are critical to the provision of the services performed under the agreement and who cannot be replaced without the Customer’s prior written consent (except if, for example, they resign or are promoted and so on).
 
Project Manager: clause 3.2
 
The Supplier is required to ensure the continuity of the Supplier’s Project Manager but has the right to replace them from time to time. A Customer may want a degree of control over the Supplier’s appointment of a replacement Project Manager.
 
Key dates: clause 3.3
 
The Supplier must perform the services in accordance with the timetables set out in  of , but the dates set out are estimates only. A Customer should consider binding the Supplier to hit key dates and making “time of the essence”, perhaps with an obligation on the Supplier to pay liquidated damages to the Customer in the event of failure to achieve any such key dates. The period for performance should be extended, or any liquidated damages reduced, where the Customer has contributed to the delay, otherwise the Supplier will have a defence to any claim for liquidated damages in these circumstances even if the delay is also due to the Supplier.
 
Right to terminate following inability to correct errors: clause 3.5
 
Under this clause, either party can terminate the agreement if the Supplier is unable to correct any Error after three attempts. A Customer would want to pin down the Supplier to timescales for correcting any Errors and may want to be paid liquidated damages if the agreement is terminated for the Supplier’s failure to correct such Errors by the relevant deadline. An unscrupulous Supplier might manipulate the right to terminate for an resolved Error in order to get out of the contract if it has realised the Services would be uneconomic to deliver at the contract price or that there is some other larger latent problem with the Managed Services: so the Customer may want this right to terminate to be exercisable only by the Customer: see alternative  and .
 
Acceptance of Managed Services: clause 3.6
 
This clause includes a simple acceptance procedure for the entire service (rather than for an individual element of it, which would be another option). If acting for a Customer, it is not usually reasonable for a Customer to agree deemed acceptance of the Service.

   3.1  The Supplier Account Team shall consist of the personnel listed in . [The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure continuity of its personnel assigned to this agreement for the duration of the Set-up Services.]

   3.2  The Supplier shall appoint the Supplier’s Project Manager, who shall have the authority to contractually bind the Supplier on all matters relating to this agreement. [Notwithstanding , the Supplier shall [use reasonable endeavours to] ensure continuity of the Supplier’s Project Manager, but has the right, in its absolute discretion, to replace them from time to time where reasonably necessary in the interests of the Supplier’s business.]

   3.3  The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to perform the Set-up Services in accordance with the timetable set out in  of  and to meet the performance dates set out in [, but any such timetable and dates shall be estimates only, and time shall not be of the essence in this agreement].

   3.4  When the Supplier considers that the Managed Services are ready for activation it shall so notify the Customer. Within [five] Business Days of such notification the Customer shall review the operation of the Managed Services to confirm that they function in material conformance with the Managed Services Specification. If the Managed Services fail in any material respect to conform with the Managed Services Specification, the Customer shall give the Supplier a detailed description of any such non-conformance (Error) in writing, within such [five] Business Day review period.

   3.5  The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to correct any Error within a reasonable time and, on completion, notify the Customer that the Managed Services are ready for activation. The provisions of  and this  shall then apply again, up to three additional times. If the Supplier is unable to correct the Error after three attempts, either party may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the other party, without further liability to the other [in respect of the Error or failure to provide the Managed Services in accordance with this agreement].

   3.6  If the Managed Services are found to conform with the Managed Services Specification or if the Customer does not provide any notification of Errors within the [five] Business Day review period described in , the Managed Services shall be deemed accepted by the Customer as from the date of the notification that the Managed Services conform or expiry of such [five] Business Day review period without notification of any Errors (in each case the Acceptance Date).

   4.  ASSUMED CONTRACTS AND ASSETS

   Assumed Contracts and Assets
 
If acting for a Customer, any novation or transfer agreement entered into by the parties that transfers the benefit of any Assumed Contracts to the Supplier should include a provision obliging the Supplier to observe and perform all the Customer’s obligations under the Assumed Contracts after the date of the transfer. The Supplier should also indemnify the Customer in respect of any loss or damage that the Customer may suffer as a result of the Supplier’s breach of any of the terms of the Assumed Contracts. The Supplier may require a reciprocal indemnity from the Customer for any pre-transfer breach.
 
If acting for the Supplier and the Assumed Contracts are required for the performance of any of the Services the agreement may need to allow the right for certain elements of the Managed Services to be de-scoped if the Assumed Contract cannot be assigned, novated or transferred and there is unlikely to be a suitable alternative.

   4.1  With effect from the Acceptance Date the Customer shall:

   (a)  transfer the Assets to the Supplier in accordance with  of ; and

   (b)  subject to , transfer the benefit of the Assumed Contracts to the Supplier provided, in each such case, that the Supplier hereby accepts and undertakes the related burden.

   4.2  The Customer shall use reasonable endeavours to assign, novate or transfer each of the Assumed Contracts to the Supplier with effect from the Acceptance Date. If any consent of any third party is required for the assignment, novation or transfer of an Assumed Contract and has not been obtained at, or before, the Acceptance Date, the Customer and the Supplier shall each use all reasonable endeavours to obtain that consent as soon as possible after the Acceptance Date. Unless or until any Assumed Contract is assigned, novated or transferred, or any necessary consent is obtained, the parties shall work together, in good faith, to agree an alternative solution which may include the Supplier finding an alternative source of supply and/or the Customer holding the benefit of the relevant Assumed Contract as agent for the Supplier.

   5.  SERVICE PROVISION

   5.1  The Supplier shall provide the Managed Services from the Acceptance Date until expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason.

   5.2  The Service Level Arrangements shall apply with effect from the start of the first complete calendar month [commencing][occurring at least [30] days] after the Acceptance Date.

   Service level arrangements
 
Under  the Service Level Arrangements can apply either from the start of the calendar month immediately following acceptance or (if the intent is to allow the Supplier a bedding in period) from the start of the calendar month occurring at least 30 days after acceptance.

   5.3  The Customer shall not store, distribute or transmit through the Managed Services any material that:

   (a)  is unlawful, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, harassing or racially or ethnically offensive;

   (b)  facilitates illegal activity;

   (c)  depicts sexually explicit images; and/or

   (d)  promotes unlawful violence, discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion, belief or gender reassignment, or any other illegal activity.

   5.4  The Customer shall remain responsible for the use of the Managed Services under its control, including any use by third parties (whether fraudulent or invited by the Customer).

   5.5  [The Customer must take reasonable measures to ensure it does not jeopardise services supplied to third parties on the same shared access infrastructure as notified to the Customer by the Supplier in writing. This includes informing the Supplier promptly in the case of a denial-of-service attack or distributed denial-of-service attack. In the event of any such incident, the Supplier shall work with the Customer to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible. The parties shall discuss and agree appropriate action (including suspending the Managed Services in whole or in part).]

   5.6  The Customer shall not provide the Managed Services directly or indirectly to third parties.

   5.7  The Supplier reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to:

   Modifications
 
 allows the Supplier to modify the Supplier’s Systems, its networks, system configurations and so on, and modify or replace any Hardware or Software. If acting for a Customer, any such modifications should be made via the Change Control Procedure set out in .
 
If acting for the Supplier, consider also including a change management process to effect changes in relation to how services are performed, see .

   (a)  modify the Supplier’s System, its network, system configurations or routing configuration; or

   (b)  modify or replace any Hardware or Software in its network or in equipment used to deliver any Service over its network,

   provided and to the extent that this has no adverse effect on the Supplier’s ability to perform its obligations under this agreement and its provision of the Services or the Service Level Arrangements. If such changes will have an adverse effect, the Supplier shall notify the Customer and the parties shall implement any necessary changes to the Managed Services through the Change Control Procedure.

   5.8  The Supplier shall comply with the Customer Policy at all times when providing the Services.

   6.  DATA PROTECTION

   Data protection
 
For more information on data protection, and the appropriate clauses to be inserted here, see .

   6.1  [INSERT APPROPRIATE DATA PROTECTION CLAUSES].

   7.  SUPPLIER’S OBLIGATIONS

   Supplier’s obligations
 
Under this clause, the Supplier undertakes to perform all Services with reasonable care and skill and the Managed Services substantially in accordance with the Managed Services Specification. All other warranties or implied terms are excluded.

   7.1  The Supplier undertakes that the Services will be performed with all reasonable skill and care and [in accordance with Good Industry Practice and] the provisions of this agreement that the Managed Services will be provided substantially in accordance with the Managed Services Specification.

   7.2  The undertaking in  shall not apply to the extent of any non-conformance that is caused by use of the Managed Services contrary to the Supplier’s instructions, including as set out in this agreement.

   7.3  If the Services do not conform with the undertaking in , the Supplier shall, at its expense, use all reasonable commercial endeavours to correct any such non-conformance promptly, or provide the Customer with an alternative means of accomplishing the desired performance. Such correction or substitution constitutes the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the undertaking in .

   Sole and exclusive remedy
 
 states that the Customer’s exclusive remedy for breach of this provision is that the Supplier will use reasonable efforts to correct any non-conformance. Customers should consider making this clause without prejudice to any of its other rights and remedies.

   7.4  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Supplier does not warrant that the Customer’s use of the Managed Services shall be uninterrupted or error-free.

   7.5  This agreement shall not prevent the Supplier from entering into similar agreements with third parties, or from independently developing, using, selling or licensing materials, products or services that are similar to those provided under this agreement.

   8.  SECURITY

   Security
 
Under this clause, the Supplier is required to ensure that appropriate safety and security systems and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access or damage to any of the Services, the Supplier’s System and the Customer Data. Customers should consider requiring the Supplier to indemnify the Customer for any breach of its security obligations set out in this clause.
 
In addition, these provisions are intended to assist OESs and RDSPs in complying with their obligations under the NIS Regulations (where these apply – see ).

   8.1  The Supplier shall: ensure at all times that appropriate safety and security systems, policies and procedures are maintained and enforced to prevent unauthorised access or damage to, and to ensure the business continuity of, any and all Services, the Supplier’s System and related networks or resources and the Customer Data, in accordance with Good Industry Practice [and the information provided in , which the Supplier warrants is up to date and accurate as of the Effective Date, with any changes to such information to be promptly notified to the Customer in writing], including an incident management process which shall enable the Supplier, as a minimum, to discover and assess Incidents, and to prioritise those Incidents, sufficient to meet its reporting obligations under ;

   Provision of cybersecurity information and adherence to policies
 
The NIS Regulations oblige OESs and RDSPs to identify (in the case of RDSPs) and manage (in the case of both OESs and RDSPs) any risks to the network and information systems on which they rely (see Regulation 10 (OESs) and Regulation 12(1) and (2) (RDSPs) of the NIS Regulations and Article 2 of EU Regulation 2018/151 (RDSPs)). Where the NIS Regulations are applicable, it will be important for the information in  to be included in the agreement so that the Customer is able to judge at the outset whether the Supplier’s security levels are sufficient for the Customer to comply with these obligations, which it will have to assess in the light of its particular business.
 
The Supplier may in return ask the Customer for a warranty that the information in  of this agreement is adequate to meet the Customer’s obligations under the NIS Regulations. This would be a reasonable request.
 
Even if a Customer is not subject to the NIS Regulations, it may still be prudent to include the information in  and these related obligations.
 
 
Business continuity
 
If the Customer is classed as an OES or RDSP under the NIS Regulations it will be under an obligation to take measures with a view to ensuring business continuity (under Regulation 10(2) and Regulation 12(1) of the NIS Regulations respectively). Such measures must be appropriate and proportionate, and so the scope of  has been expanded to cover the business continuity of the managed services and Supplier systems, as well as their cybersecurity.
 
Even if the Customer is not subject to the NIS Regulations, it is still likely to be interested to place an obligation on the Supplier to ensure continuity of the managed services to some degree, depending on how business critical those services are. See also  in this regard.
 
In addition to the inclusion of this clause, the Customer will likely want to review the Supplier’s business continuity policies to verify their appropriateness and sufficiency prior to signing this agreement.

   8.2  The Supplier shall ensure that the Supplier’s System is designed, maintained and upgraded at all times so as to Mitigate against Incidents. The parties agree that if Incidents are detected or discovered, each of them shall co-operate with the other to Mitigate the Incident and, particularly if the Incident causes or threatens the loss of operational efficiency, loss or corruption of Customer Data, or the reduced management of risks posed to the security of the Assets, the Supplier’s System, or the Customer’s Operating Environment, the parties shall assist each other to mitigate any losses and restore the Services to their original operating and security efficiency. The costs of complying with this  shall be apportioned between the parties on a pro rata basis according to fault.

   Mitigation against incidents
 
 places the Supplier under a specific obligation to address security vulnerabilities inherent in the managed services, as well as taking reasonable steps to avoid viruses and defend against general security incidents as they happen.
 
A Supplier may try to limit its obligations under  to “known” incidents, which may be reasonable but will require careful consideration and drafting. In the case of vulnerabilities, it is recommended that this captures, at least, Known Vulnerabilities and Latent Vulnerabilities (see ). It may be argued that the definition of Mitigation already provides the Supplier with a level of comfort in this regard, as the Supplier’s obligations are limited to those reasonable steps to be taken in accordance with Good Industry Practice, and so presumably would not cover what they could not reasonably be expected to know about.

   8.3  The Customer shall promptly inform the Supplier if it suspects or uncovers any Incident and, subject to the cost allocations in , shall use all commercially reasonable endeavours to promptly mitigate such Incident.

   8.4  The Supplier shall:

   (a)  notify the Customer immediately if it becomes aware of any Incident and respond without delay to all queries and requests for information from the Customer about any Incident, whether discovered by the Supplier or the Customer, in particular bearing in mind the extent of any reporting obligations the Customer may have under applicable data protection or cybersecurity legislation and that the Customer may be required to comply with statutory or other regulatory timescales;

   Reporting security incidents to regulators
 
 is intended to help the Customer comply with any statutory duty it may have to report security incidents under the NIS Regulations (and more broadly, under any applicable data protection legislation). The provisions for notification of a security incident under the NIS Regulations require reporting within 72 hours of the OES or RDSP becoming aware of the incident (Regulations 11 and 12). The NIS Regulations require certain information to be provided. The Customer could specify in a schedule the types of information it would require under the NIS Regulations to assess the severity of the incident and that it would need in order to make any notification to the regulator. However, in this standard agreement we have opted to rely on the general obligations in .
 
We have used a broad definition of “Incident” here to capture issues such as software vulnerabilities and virus infiltrations as well as external security threats.
 
Even if a Customer is not subject to the NIS Regulations or GDPR, it may still be prudent to include , although whether it will be acceptable to the Supplier will likely depend on the risk in practice of the Supplier’s services being able to compromise the security of the Customer’s network and information system

   (b)  at the Customer’s cost, promptly cooperate with any request for information made in respect of:

   (i)  any Incident;

   (ii)  any of the information provided in  or any policies referred to in ; or

   (iii)  any requests for information, or inspection, made by a regulator with competent jurisdiction over the Customer (including in connection with any applicable data protection or cybersecurity legislation).

   Co-operation
 
Where applicable, regulation 16 of the NIS Regulations contains provisions enabling regulators to carry out inspections to check that OESs and RDSPs are complying with their security and notification requirements. The NIS Regulations do not specify that these inspections would be limited to the premises of the OES or RDSP. The Customer may rely on the co-operation of the Supplier both in the event of an inspection and to comply with other aspects of the NIS Regulations or with guidance published by its regulator.
 
 are likely to be helpful to the Customer, even if it is not subject to the NIS Regulations, as it applies to cybersecurity matters more generally.

   8.5  The Supplier shall follow its archiving and security procedures for Customer Data, including those set out in this  [and as described in ].

   Archiving and security procedures
 
A Customer may want to impose an obligation on the Supplier to comply with the Customer’s own policies and procedures and include these as part of Schedule 4. In respect of security the Supplier must also comply with its obligations under this  (Security).

   8.6  The Supplier shall promptly notify the Customer in writing of any actual or suspected loss or damage to the Customer Data. In the event of any loss or damage to Customer Data, the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be for the Supplier to use reasonable commercial endeavours to restore the lost or damaged Customer Data from the latest backup of such Customer Data [to be maintained by the Supplier in accordance with the archiving procedure described in ]. The Supplier shall not be responsible for any loss, destruction, alteration or unauthorised access to or disclosure of Customer Data caused by any third party (except those third parties sub-contracted by the Supplier to perform services related to Customer Data maintenance and back-up).

   Loss or damage to Customer Data
 
While the Supplier will want to include this , the Customer is very likely to resist it, particularly where it operates to exclude or limit the Supplier’s liability in relation to any of its wider cybersecurity obligations (including those included under this ) or data protection obligations (including any that are to be included as part of ). This provision is likely to be even more contentious where the Customer is subject to the NIS Regulations, see . If the Customer agrees to this  at all, it is likely to require that the Supplier’s regulatory obligations with respect to data protection and cybersecurity (including any flow-down of the Customer’s regulatory obligations) are carved out from the scope of this .
 
If this clause (or a modified version of this clause) is accepted by the Customer, the Customer may want to consider alternative disaster recovery back-up or the purchase enhanced data back-up services from the Supplier as an additional service for additional fees.

   8.7  [The Supplier shall indemnify the Customer for any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable professional advisers’ costs and disbursements, and reasonable legal costs and disbursements) arising from or incurred by reason of any breach by the Supplier of its obligations under this .]

   8.8  [The Supplier shall comply with, and shall procure that each of the sub-contractors complies with, the Customer’s procedures for vetting personnel in respect of all of Supplier’s personnel employed or engaged in the provision of the Services.]

   8.9  [The Customer shall have the right, in its absolute discretion, to require the Supplier not to use specified individuals employed or engaged by the Supplier, or by a sub-contractor, in the performance of specified elements of the Services. The Customer shall not exercise this right in breach of any law.]

   9.  CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS

   Customer’s obligations
 
If acting for the Customer, it should be considered which of these obligations should be:
 
Obligations on the Customer, failure to comply with which would be considered a breach of the agreement.
Purely responsibility allocation between the parties, failure to comply with which would lead to relief from liability for the Supplier to the extent caused by the Customer’s failure.

   9.1  The Customer shall:

   (a)  provide the Supplier with:

   (i)  all necessary co-operation in relation to this agreement; and

   (ii)  all necessary access to such information as may be reasonably required by the Supplier,

   in order to provide the Services, including Customer Data, security access information, and (subject to providing any confidentiality undertakings reasonably required by the Customer) software interfaces to the Customer’s other business applications;

   (b)  provide such personnel assistance, including the Customer Account Team and other Customer personnel, as may be reasonably requested by the Supplier from time to time. The Customer Account Team shall initially consist of the personnel listed in . [The Customer shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure continuity of its personnel assigned to this agreement];

   Customer account team
 
If acting for the Customer, consider whether this should apply throughout the entire term of the agreement, or be limited to the initial phase(s), or certain tasks only, or parts of the Customer’s business or level of personnel.

   (c)  appoint the Customer’s Project Manager, who shall have the authority to contractually bind the Customer on all matters relating to this agreement. [The Customer shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure continuity of the Customer’s Project Manager, but has the right, in its absolute discretion, to replace them from time to time where reasonably necessary in the interests of the Customer’s business];

   (d)  comply with all applicable and regulations with respect to its activities under this agreement, including those set out in ; and

   (e)  carry out all other Customer responsibilities and obligations set out in this agreement (including the Project Plan) or in any of the Schedules in a timely and efficient manner. In the event of any delays in the Customer’s provision of such assistance as agreed by the parties or performance of the Customer’s responsibilities and obligations, the Supplier [may adjust any timetable or delivery schedule set out in this agreement as reasonably necessary][shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the date or dates in any time schedule or, if the Supplier incurs additional costs to avoid or mitigate the effects of Customer’s failure or delay in providing such assistance or performance of its responsibilities and obligations, the Supplier shall be entitled to make an equitable adjustment to the Fees (or a combination of the two as appropriate). The starting basis for determining the equitable adjustment to the Fees for the purposes of this  shall be the Supplier’s reasonable increased costs to the extent the same cannot be Mitigated. All such equitable adjustments shall be recorded through the Change Control Procedure as an agreed change].

   Consequence of customer delay
 
If acting for the Customer, consider whether this should be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Supplier for the Customer’s failure to fulfil its obligations and responsibilities.
 
If acting for the Supplier, consider deleting the obligation to require adjustments to timing and fees to go through change control (or if that is not possible, consider a fast track change control process for such changes).

   10.  WARRANTIES

   Warranties
 
Some fairly standard warranties have been included in this clause. A Customer should consider whether any additional warranties may be required, including, for example, those in square brackets in  and .

   10.1  The Customer warrants and represents that:

   (a)  it has the full capacity and authority to enter into and perform this agreement and that this agreement is executed by a duly authorised representative of the Customer;

   (b)  it has the authority to grant any rights to be granted by the Customer to the Supplier under this agreement, (including the right to transfer the Assets to the Supplier as indicated in, and in accordance with, this agreement) and for the same to be used in the provision of the Services and otherwise in connection with this agreement; and

   (c)  it owns or has obtained valid licences, consents, permissions and rights to use and where necessary to license to the Supplier, any materials reasonably necessary for the fulfilment of all the Customer’s obligations under this agreement, including any third-party licences and consents in respect of any Customer Software.

   10.2  The Customer warrants that:

   (a)  it shall comply with and use the Services in accordance with the terms of this agreement and all applicable laws, and shall not do any act that shall infringe the rights of any third party including the publishing or transmission of any materials contrary to relevant laws [or in breach of the Acceptable Use Policy];

   (b)  it shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the Customer in performing its obligations under this agreement; and

   (c)  the Supplier’s possession and use in accordance with this agreement of any materials (including third-party materials) supplied by the Customer to the Supplier shall not cause the Supplier to infringe the rights, including any Intellectual Property Rights, of any third party.

   10.3  The Supplier warrants and represents that:

   (a)  it has the full capacity and authority to enter into and perform this agreement and that this agreement is executed by a duly authorised representative of the Supplier;

   (b)  it owns, or has obtained all valid licences, consents, permissions and rights necessary to enable the Supplier to comply with its obligations under this agreement and to use any of the Intellectual Property Rights necessary for the fulfilment of all its obligations under this agreement including for the Customer’s use and receipt of the Services, and the Supplier shall not breach the provisions of any such necessary licences, consents, permissions and rights or cause the same to be breached;

   (c)  [all representations made by the Supplier in its best and final offer/response to the Customer’s request for proposal are true, complete, accurate and not misleading.]

   10.4  The Supplier warrants that:

   (a)  [the Supplier shall not make any statement, orally or in writing, publicly or privately, or do any act or otherwise conduct itself in such a manner as will or may in the reasonable opinion of the Customer disparage the Customer, its clients or customers, its or their business, products or services;]

   (b)  it shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the Supplier in performing its obligations under this agreement;

   Compliance with laws
 
The Supplier may wish to limit this compliance obligation to laws and regulations which apply as of the effective date only, with any changes of law to be dealt with by way of a change control request (see  and ), however a Customer is likely to resist this.
 
In addition, the Supplier may wish to be clear that it is not taking on responsibility for any heightened cybersecurity obligations which the Customer might be subject to if it is classified as an OES or a RDSP under the NIS Regulations, see .
 
For an example, of a warranty disclaimer which might be used in such circumstances, see .

   (c)  [it is and shall remain throughout the term of this agreement compliant (and certified by an independent, reputable and competent certification body to be compliant) with, and shall provide the Services in line with, a then-current version of International Standards Organisation (ISO) / International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL));]

   Certification to international standards (optional)
 
If cybersecurity is of concern here, the Customer may wish to ensure the Supplier is compliant with certain international recognised cybersecurity standards (such as ICO 27001).
 
Another standard to consider is the UK’s Cyber Essentials Scheme (see ). The Cyber Essentials Scheme is seen as a relatively basic standard and (like ICO 27001) is not aligned to (and, accordingly, cannot be said to meet) any standard required under the NIS Regulations or UK GDPR (should this be applicable), but it does at least provide some comfort that the Supplier has met a minimum standard of cybersecurity.

   (d)  the Customer’s possession and use in accordance with this agreement of any materials (including third-party materials) supplied by the Supplier to the Customer shall not cause the Customer to infringe the rights, including any Intellectual Property Rights, of any third party;

   (e)  any software, systems or telecommunications used or provided by or on behalf of the Supplier in performing its obligations under this agreement shall be tested for Viruses and [Latent Vulnerabilities and Known] Vulnerabilities and any of the same that are identified shall be Mitigated against before the date of use of such software, systems or telecommunications by the Supplier;

   (f)  all personnel and sub-contractors used by the Supplier in the performance of this agreement are adequately skilled and experienced for the activities they are required to perform; and

   (g)  it will not introduce, or permit the introduction of, any Viruses or [Known Vulnerabilities or Latent] Vulnerabilities into Customer’s Operating Environment, or the Customer’s other network and information systems, while performing the Services.

   11.  CHARGES AND PAYMENT

   Charges and payment
 
The standard document assumes a simple fee structure, with one fee for Set-up Services and another set monthly fee for the Managed Services. Other, more sophisticated options are also possible, such as per-unit pricing (for example, per desktop), pay as you go (for use where the Customer only pays for processing power or storage that it is actually using) or even a cost-plus model.
 
There is no provision for the monthly fees to change during the life of the contract other than as set out in ,  and .

   11.1  The Customer shall pay the Fees for the Set-Up Services Fees and the monthly Fees for the Managed Services, each as set out in .

   11.2  The Customer shall reimburse the Supplier for all actual, reasonable travel costs and expenses including travel, hotels and meals incurred by the Supplier in performance of the Set-up Services.

   Expenses
 
Under , the Supplier is reimbursed for expenses incurred during the set-up phase, but nothing is stated about any expenses during the ongoing service-provision phase. This is consistent with the idea that the Supplier is taking over responsibility for the entire service and the Customer is simply paying a fixed monthly fee. If acting for the Customer, consider defining and limiting the scope of any expenses payable to the Supplier and imposing a financial cap on the expenses that can be recovered by the Supplier. In addition, any expenses should only be incurred with the prior written agreement of the Customer and in accordance with the Customer’s expenses policy.

   11.3  All payments made by the Customer under this agreement are exclusive of VAT. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a valid VAT invoice. The Customer shall pay any stamp duties or similar transfer taxes imposed on the supplies made under this agreement and shall reimburse the Supplier for any such stamp duties or similar transfer taxes paid by the Supplier. If the Customer is required to make any deduction for or on account of tax from any payment due under this agreement (Tax Deduction):

   (a)  The Customer shall account to the relevant tax authority for such Tax Deduction and shall provide evidence to the Supplier that it has so accounted.

   (b)  The amount of the payment due under this Agreement shall be increased so that the Supplier receives an amount equal to the amount that would have been received by it, had the Customer not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   Tax
 
Unless each party wishes to bear the tax risks “as they fall”, there must be appropriate provisions relating to tax payments (such as value added taxes) and tax withholding requirements. It may be necessary to have wording to deal with tax withholding, particularly in respect of licence fees, where that is relevant. It is always advisable to obtain expert tax advice on the structuring of payments before any agreement is entered into.

   11.4  The Customer and the Supplier shall co-operate to minimise the amount of any Tax Deduction. If following the making of a Tax Deduction, the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion/ acting in good faith] that it (or any member of the Supplier’s group) has received and retained any credit, relief or other benefit as a result of the Tax Deduction, the Supplier shall pay such amount to the Customer as the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion/ acting in good faith] would leave the Supplier in the same position as if the Customer had not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   11.5  The Supplier shall invoice the Customer monthly [in arrears] as of the last day of each month for all Services performed by the Supplier during that preceding month. If any Service Credits are [claimed and] due then they shall be shown as a deduction from the invoice.

   11.6  If the Customer fails to make any payment due to the Supplier under this agreement by the due date for payment, then, without limiting the Supplier’s remedies under , the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [4]% per annum above [FULL NAME OF BANK]’s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.

   11.7  On expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason, any unpaid Service Credits [claimed and accruing shall] represent a debt due from the Supplier to the Customer.

   12.  CHANGE CONTROL

   12.1  If either party wishes to change the scope [or execution] of the Services (including Customer requests for additional services), it shall submit details of the requested change to the other in writing.

   Change management
 
Consider including a system of change management for changes to how services are performed rather than change control. If a substantial change is required, this, in any event is likely to be a change to the service. See .

   12.2  If either party requests a change to the scope [or execution] of the Services, the Supplier shall, within a reasonable time, provide a written estimate to the Customer of:

   (a)  the likely time required to implement the change;

   (b)  any variations to the Fees arising from the change;

   (c)  the likely effect of the change on the Project Plan; and

   (d)  any other impact of the change on the terms of this agreement.

   12.3  If the Supplier requests a change to the scope or execution of the Services, the Customer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to it. If the Customer requests a change pursuant to , or a change is proposed pursuant to , the Supplier shall not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to it.

   12.4  If either party wishes the other party to proceed with the relevant change referred to in , the Supplier has no obligation to do so unless and until the parties have agreed in writing the necessary variations to its charges, the Project Plan and any other relevant terms of this agreement to take account of the change.

   Changes required by law or regulation
 
Various clauses in this agreement oblige both parties to comply with applicable laws (see, for example, ,  and  with such laws potentially evolving over the course of the engagement, see  and ).
 
A supplier, or manager, of technical solutions might be particularly mindful of the fact that, while its solution might be legally compliant as of the effective date of an agreement, certain legal and regulatory standards (such as data protection or cybersecurity standards) may evolve over the course of the engagement (particularly, where it is committing to a longer contract term) to the financial detriment of the supplier.
 
In such cases, the Supplier may only be willing to agree to comply with those applicable laws which are in force as of the effective date (in which case you should limit the obligations, accordingly). In the event laws or regulations change over the course of the agreement, and require a corresponding change to the Managed Services or the Services Requirements, the Supplier may want to make it clear that this is to be classified as a change control, and for this  to be invoked. The parties may wish to allocate or share any increased costs relating to legal or regulatory changes. A Customer is not likely to accept any ability for the Supplier to reject a change control dictated by changes in law, while the Supplier may require a termination right in the event the change control will have a significant financial impact on it.
 
For an example of a how to deal with a change in regulatory requirements (such as a change in cybersecurity standards) see .

   13.  [PRICE REDUCTION OR BENCHMARKING]

   Price reduction OR Benchmarking (optional)
 
 offers two alternatives:
 
That prices fall by a fixed percentage every year, but this will only be useful in specific situations. In the current economic climate, this is unlikely to be accepted by a Supplier.
That the parties may undertake a Benchmark Review in accordance with .
If that review determines that the fees are not Good Value (defined in  to mean no more than 10% above the median price in the market), then the Supplier is obliged to propose changes to the agreement, including a new initial term, so that the revised fees would represent Good Value. This proposal may include changes to the Managed Services Specification or to the Service Level Arrangements.
There are, of course, many other alternatives that the parties may agree as a consequence of the benchmark review. A Supplier might, for example, be obliged to reduce its prices down to a level representing Good Value. At the other extreme, a determination that the fees are not Good Value may simply trigger a discussion between the parties.
Note that the suggested definition of Good Value is one that will usually favour the Supplier.
Note also that the Supplier may seek to reduce the frequency of Benchmark Reviews.

   13.1  [Each year from the first day of the month falling after the anniversary of the Acceptance Date, the Fees will reduce by [PERCENTAGE]%.

   The Customer may, by written notice, require a Benchmark Review of the Managed Services in accordance with the provisions of . The first Benchmark Review may not take place until at least [18] months after the Acceptance Date and each subsequent Benchmark Review must be at least [12] months after the previous one.

   OR

   13.2  Subject to , if any Benchmark Review determines that the Fees do not represent Good Value (as defined in ), the Supplier shall, in accordance with  and within [three months] of completion of the Benchmark Review, make a proposal for a new solution, with Fees representing Good Value in accordance with the recommendations of the Benchmarker under  of , and any related modifications to the Managed Services Specification, the Service Level Arrangements and (if the Supplier deems it appropriate) the Initial Term.

   13.3  On receipt of the proposal from the Supplier under  the Customer shall have the option to:

   (a)  accept the new proposal in which case the parties shall record the change in accordance with ; [OR]

   (b)  reject the proposal and elect to continue to receive the Managed Services on the existing basis[; OR ]

   (c)  [reject the proposal and terminate this agreement on [three months’] notice in writing to the Supplier without cost other than the Fees up to the date of such termination.]

   Termination for rejection of changes (optional)
 
If acting for the Supplier, consider whether the rejection of changes that redress the finding by a Benchmarker should be a termination trigger as this might undermine any minimum Initial Term and pricing that might be based on recovery of initial expenditure over such minimum Initial Term.

   13.4  If the Supplier reasonably believes the Benchmarker has not complied with the provisions of  in any material respect, or that the Benchmarker has made a manifest error in determining the results of the Benchmark Review, the Supplier may dispute the Benchmark Report and the matter shall be dealt with in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.]

   14.  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

   Continuous improvement
 
One of the main reasons Customers enter into managed services contracts is to ensure that their use of technology will remain up to date throughout the life of the agreement.  suggests a simple way to achieve this: the Supplier will report to the Customer annually identifying any new technologies that could improve the Managed Services. The report will give sufficient detail to enable the Customer to evaluate the new technology. If the Customer then wants to incorporate any improvements, it will submit a change request in accordance with .

   14.1  The Supplier shall, at its own cost and expense, submit a report to the Customer within 20 Business Days following each anniversary of the Acceptance Date identifying the emergence of new and evolving relevant technologies or process changes in the IT, telecommunications or data centre field relevant to the Managed Services. Such report shall be provided in sufficient detail to enable the Customer to evaluate properly the benefits of the new technology or process.

   14.2  If the Customer wishes to incorporate any improvement identified by the Supplier under , the Customer shall send the Supplier a change request for consideration in accordance with  provided always the parties agree that:

   (a)  if the Supplier’s costs and expenses incurred in relation to providing the Managed Services to the Customer are reduced as a result of any business change implemented by the Customer, [PERCENTAGE]% of such cost savings shall be passed on to the Customer by way of a consequential and immediate reduction in the Fees with effect from the date the relevant change is agreed in accordance with ; and

   (b)  if the charges payable by the Customer are reduced as a result of any business change implemented by the Supplier, [PERCENTAGE]% of the Customer’s savings shall be passed on to the Supplier by way of a consequential increase in the Fees with effect from the date the relevant change is agreed in accordance with .

   Cost sharing
 
 aims to incorporate an element of sharing the costs and benefits of technology change as between the parties. If the Supplier’s costs in providing the service are reduced, there will be a proportionate reduction in the fees (). Conversely, if the charges payable by the Customer are reduced as a result of a change, there will be a proportionate increase in the fees. Of course, the negotiation process may produce many variations of this provision.
 
If acting for the Supplier and dependent on the charging mechanisms, consider whether this allows adequate recovery of initial expenditure that is intended to be recovered over the Initial Term.

   15.  SERVICE REVIEW AND GOVERNANCE

   15.1  The Customer’s Project Manager and the Supplier’s Project Manager shall have regular monthly meetings (Monthly Meetings) to monitor and review the performance of the Services under this agreement, to discuss any changes proposed in accordance with  and to discuss the Service Level Arrangements. These meetings shall be minuted by the Supplier’s Project Manager and copies of those minutes shall be circulated to, and approved by, both parties.

   15.2  Before each Monthly Meeting, the Customer’s Project Manager shall notify the Supplier’s Project Manager, and vice versa, of any problems relating to the provision of the Services for discussion at the Monthly Meeting. At each such meeting, the parties shall agree a plan to address such problems. In the event of any problem being unresolved or a failure to agree on the plan, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure. Progress in implementing the plan shall be included in the agenda for the next Monthly Meeting.

   15.3  A review meeting to assess the performance of the Supplier in the delivery of the Managed Services shall be held at [six-monthly] intervals (Review Meeting). Each meeting shall be attended by senior representatives of the Customer and of the Supplier, together with the Customer’s Project Manager and Supplier’s Project Manager.

   15.4  The Customer and the Supplier shall review the Service Level Arrangement at each Review Meeting and shall, in accordance with , agree modifications to reflect changes in the Customer’s requirements for the Managed Services.

   16.  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

   Proprietary rights
 
 to  relate to the parties’ pre-existing intellectual property rights (IPR) and IPR developed pursuant to this agreement.
 
 and  relate to third party IPR.
 
 is a catch-all protection; if the clause is mutual and rights created under this agreement are transferred to the Customer (option 2 under ), it should refer to rights transferred in or pursuant to the agreement, as well as to rights granted.

   16.1  Nothing in this agreement affects either party’s rights in and to any Intellectual Property Rights that existed prior to the date of this agreement (including pre-existing Intellectual Property Rights of either party contained in or relating to Confidential Information).

   16.2  [The Customer acknowledges and agrees that, as between the parties, the Supplier and/or its licensors own all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product and in all other materials connected with the provision of the Services and/or developed or produced in connection with this agreement by the Supplier, its officers, employees, sub-contractors or agents. Except as expressly stated in this agreement, this agreement does not grant the Customer any rights to such Intellectual Property Rights.

   OR

   The Customer shall:

   (a)  own and retain all rights, title and interest in and to:

   (i)  the Work Product; and

   (ii)  all deliverables and all other reports, documents, materials, techniques, ideas, concepts, trade marks, know-how, algorithms, software, computer code, routines or sub-routines, specifications, plans, notes, drawings, designs, pictures, images, text, audiovisual works, inventions, data, information and other items, expressions, works of authorship or work product of any kind that are provided by any supplier (other than the Supplier or any of its sub-contractors), consultant, contractor, advisor or any other third party engaged by the Customer in relation to the Services, the Customer Site or its business requirements.

   (b)  be deemed to be the author of all Work Product. The Supplier waives and shall procure that any relevant employee, agent or sub-contractor and their respective personnel waive any and all moral rights (including any rights of attribution) in and to the Work Product. To the extent that any Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product do not automatically vest in the Customer, the Supplier (by way of present assignment of future rights where appropriate) assigns absolutely and irrevocably (and shall procure that any relevant employee, agent or sub-contractor assigns absolutely and irrevocably) to the Customer with full title guarantee all rights, title and interest that the Supplier (and any of its employees, agents or sub-contractors) may have or may in future acquire in all Work Product, including all Intellectual Property Rights in any Work Product, for the full term of such rights throughout the world].

   Ownership of created IPR
 
Two alternatives have been included in  for ownership of IPR created under this agreement:
 
Under the first option in  all IPR in anything specifically developed for the Customer is owned by the Supplier. Strictly speaking, this clause is not necessary, since the starting point is that IPR is owned by the entity which created it. However, a court may imply an assignment to the Customer if this is necessary to give effect to the underlying commercial bargain and in any event it is sensible to ensure that both parties have common understanding of IPR ownership and licence position. If this option is selected, then  should be omitted. In this case, the Supplier’s licence of IPR to the Customer () will comprise both the IPR specifically developed by the Supplier for the Customer and the Supplier’s pre-existing IPR, and the Customer’s licence to the Supplier () will relate only to the Customer’s pre-existing IPR.
If the Customer uses the second option in , all the remaining sub-clauses will be relevant. In this scenario, the Customer will own all IPR in the Work Product developed specifically for the Customer.  contains wording required for a present assignment of future rights under . Where the present assignment of future rights works, nothing more should be required. Consequently, further steps should only be necessary under  if the Supplier or sub-contractor defaults (or the Supplier fails to include the appropriate wording in its sub-contract), so it is reasonable that the Supplier bears the cost of any extra documentation and so on that is required under . When the second option is chosen, the licence granted to the Customer by the Supplier in  will relate only to the Supplier’s pre-existing IPR. The Customer’s licence to the Supplier () will comprise both the Customer’s pre-existing IPR and the IPR in the Work Product transferred to the Customer. The licence to the Supplier of the Customer’s IPR () only needs to last for the term of the agreement and to permit use for the purposes of providing products and services to the Customer, as the Supplier may only use such IPR for the purpose of performing the agreement. In contrast, if the Supplier’s pre-existing IPR is key to the Customer’s use of the Work Product and this is embedded in the Customer’s ongoing business, the Customer may want its rights to use the Supplier’s pre-existing IPR to continue after the expiry or termination of the agreement. Describing the licence as perpetual and irrevocable should mean that it is harder for the Supplier to terminate the licence for the Customer’s breach, but even if so described the Customer probably cannot eliminate entirely the possibility that the licence can be terminated if the Customer commits a very serious beach or persistent and material breaches.

   16.3  [At its own cost and expense, the Supplier shall execute all documents and take all actions necessary or reasonably requested by the Customer to document, obtain, renew, maintain, perfect or assign the Customer’s rights to the Work Product. At its own cost and expense, the Supplier shall also cause its employees, agents and sub-contractors to execute such documents and take such actions as described in this . The Supplier shall not challenge (and shall procure that its employees, agents and sub-contractors shall not challenge) the validity of the Supplier’s (or any of its employees’, agents’ or sub-contractors’) assignment of rights in the Work Product to the Customer in accordance with . All such Work Product shall be deemed to be the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Customer under and subject to the provisions of .]

   Further assurance (optional)
 
This clause should be omitted where the Supplier is to own IPR in the Work Product under the relevant option to be selected in , see .

   16.4  The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that the Customer owns and retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Customer Data. Save to the extent necessary for the provision of the Services and performance of its obligations under this agreement, the Supplier shall have no rights to access, use or modify the Customer Data unless it has the prior written consent of the Customer.

   16.5  The Supplier grants to the Customer a perpetual (for the term of this agreement and thereafter), irrevocable, sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to [use, exploit, sell, copy, reproduce, manufacture, distribute, export, publicly display, publicly perform, sub-license, modify, improve, enhance and make derivative works of] all of the Supplier’s Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent and as incorporated by the Supplier into the Work Product solely in connection with the Customer’s (and its permitted sub-licensees’) use of the Work Product in accordance with this agreement.

   16.6  The Customer grants to the Supplier a revocable, sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide limited licence for the term of this agreement to use, exploit, copy, reproduce, manufacture, sub-license, modify, improve, enhance and make derivative works of the Customer’s Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent and as incorporated into the Work Product and solely to the extent necessary to enable the Supplier to comply with its obligations under this agreement.

   16.7  The Supplier shall not disclose to the Customer or use in its work any trade secrets or confidential information of a third party which the Supplier is not lawfully entitled to disclose or use in such manner. The Supplier shall not use any equipment, supplies, facilities, computer code, work product, inventions or materials of any other third party (Third-Party Materials) in any Work Product or in the Supplier’s performance under this agreement unless:

   (a)  the Supplier has the full right and authority to do so without violating any rights of any third party;

   (b)  the Supplier has obtained all necessary rights to enable it to perform its obligations under this agreement and grant the rights granted pursuant to this agreement, and to permit the Customer to utilise the Third-Party Materials as contemplated under this agreement, in each case at no additional cost or expense to the Customer;

   (c)  the Customer’s use of such Third-Party Materials will not restrict or impair in any manner its use of the Work Product or subject the Customer to any obligation or liability; and

   (d)  such Third-Party Materials are specifically identified to the Customer in writing in advance of any use and the Customer has agreed in writing to such use.

   16.8  The Supplier grants to the Customer a perpetual (for the term of this agreement and thereafter), irrevocable, sub-licensable, non-transferrable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to [use, exploit, sell, copy, reproduce, manufacture, distribute, export, publicly display, publicly perform, sub-license, modify, improve, enhance and make derivative works of] such Third-Party Materials solely to the extent and as are incorporated in the Work Product solely in connection with the Customer’s (and its permitted sub-licensees’) use of the Work Product in accordance with this agreement.

   16.9  [The Customer reserves all rights not expressly granted in this agreement] OR [Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted [or transferred] in [or pursuant to] this agreement].

   17.  DOMAIN NAMES

   Domain names
 
 imposes an obligation on the Supplier to procure a domain name on the Customer’s behalf if instructed to do so by the Customer. The parties should consider whether this clause is applicable in the relevant circumstances.

   17.1  If the Customer instructs the Supplier to obtain a domain name for the Customer, the Supplier shall act as an agent for the Customer in dealing with the relevant domain name registration authority. The contract for the domain name shall be between the Customer and the relevant domain name registration authority and the Customer agrees that it shall be solely responsible for renewals, and for legal, technical, administrative, billing or other requirements imposed by the relevant domain name registration authority (and relevant costs and expenses thereof).

   17.2  The Supplier gives no warranty in relation to such domain name, including that the domain name requested shall not infringe the rights of any third party and all such enquiries shall be the responsibility of the Customer. The domain name shall form part of the Customer’s Intellectual Property Rights for the purposes of this agreement.

   17.3  If the Supplier licenses to the Customer an IP address as part of the Services, such IP address shall (to the extent permitted by law) revert to the Supplier after expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason, whereupon the Customer shall cease using the address. At any time after such expiry or termination, the Supplier may re-assign the address to another user.

   18.  CONFIDENTIALITY

   Confidentiality
 
For information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to 
.

   18.1  Confidential Information means all confidential information (however recorded or preserved) disclosed by a party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the other party and that party’s Representatives [whether before or] [after the date of this agreement] in connection with [DESCRIBE TRANSACTION OR CONTRACT], including but not limited to:

   (a)  the [existence and] terms of this agreement [or any agreement entered into in connection with this agreement];

   (b)  any information that would be regarded as confidential by a reasonable business person relating to:

   (i)  the business, assets, affairs, customers, clients, suppliers, [or] plans [, intentions, or market opportunities] of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)]; and

   (ii)  the operations, processes, product information, know-how, designs, trade secrets or software of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)];

   (c)  any information developed by the parties in the course of carrying out this agreement; and

   (d)  any information detailed in Schedule [NUMBER].

   18.2  Representatives means, in relation to a party, its employees, officers, contractors, subcontractors, representatives and advisers.

   18.3  The provisions of this  shall not apply to any Confidential Information that:

   (a)  is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in breach of this );

   (b)  was available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before disclosure by the disclosing party;

   (c)  was, is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a person who, to the receiving party’s knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party or otherwise prohibited from disclosing the information to the receiving party; [or]

   (d)  the parties agree in writing is not confidential or may be disclosed[ ; or]

   (e)  is developed by or for the receiving party independently of the information disclosed by the disclosing party.

   18.4  Each party shall keep the other party’s Confidential Information secret and confidential and shall not:

   (a)  use such Confidential Information except for [the purpose of exercising or performing its rights and obligations under or in connection with this agreement OR [SPECIFY PURPOSE]] (Permitted Purpose); or

   (b)  disclose such Confidential Information in whole or in part to any third party, except as expressly permitted by this .

   18.5  A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to those of its Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, provided that:

   (a)  it informs such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information before disclosure; and

   (b)  at all times, it is responsible for such Representatives’ compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in this .

   18.6  [The Customer:

   (a)  acknowledges and agrees that the Supplier’s Confidential Information includes the Work Product; and

   (b)  agrees not to make use of the Work Product for any purpose other than receipt and proper use of the Services in accordance with this agreement.]

   Work Product
 
This  should only be included where it is agreed that the Supplier will own IPR in the Work Product under the relevant option in .

   18.7  The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that the Customer Data is the Confidential Information of the Customer.

   18.8  A party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, by any governmental or other regulatory authority (including, without limitation, [ANY RELEVANT SECURITIES EXCHANGES]) or by a court, arbitral or administrative tribunal or other authority of competent jurisdiction provided that, to the extent it is legally permitted to do so, it gives the other party as much notice of such disclosure as possible [and, where notice of disclosure is not prohibited and is given in accordance with this , it takes into account the reasonable requests of the other party in relation to the content of such disclosure].

   18.9  [A party may, provided that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party is involved in activity that may constitute a criminal offence under the Bribery Act 2010, disclose Confidential Information to the Serious Fraud Office without first informing the other party of such disclosure.]

   18.10  Each party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights or obligations in respect of a party’s Confidential Information other than those expressly stated in this agreement are granted to the other party or to be implied from this agreement.

   18.11  Except as expressly stated in this agreement, no party makes any express or implied warranty or representation concerning its Confidential Information.

   18.14  [No party shall make, or permit any person to make, any public announcement concerning this agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as required by law, any governmental or regulatory authority (including any relevant securities exchange), any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction.]

   19.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   Limitation of liability
 
For more information on limitation of liability, see:
 
.
.

.
.
.
.
Customers should consider obliging the Supplier to obtain and maintain appropriate insurance cover in the light of its obligations under the agreement (including its liability and indemnity obligations). The Supplier should be required to provide the Customer with a copy of its insurance schedule showing the level of insurance cover that the Supplier benefits from.

   19.1  This  sets out the entire financial liability of the Supplier (including any liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents and sub-contractors) to the Customer in respect of:

   (a)  any breach of this agreement;

   (b)  any use made by the Customer of the Services; and

   (c)  any representation, misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), statement or tortious act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with this agreement.

   19.2  Except as expressly provided in this agreement:

   (a)  the Customer assumes sole responsibility for results obtained from the use of the Services, and for conclusions drawn from such use. The Supplier shall have no liability for any damage caused by errors or omissions in any information, instructions or scripts provided to the Supplier by the Customer in connection with the Services, or any actions taken by the Supplier at the Customer’s direction; and

   (b)  all warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute, common law or otherwise are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from this agreement.

   19.3  Nothing in this agreement excludes or limits the liability of the [Supplier OR either party] for:

   (a)  death or personal injury caused by the Supplier’s negligence;

   (b)  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; [or]

   (c)  any other liability which cannot lawfully be excluded or limited; [or]

   (d)  [in the case of the Customer, the Customer’s obligation to pay the Fees.]

   19.4  [The Service Level Arrangements state the Customer’s sole and exclusive right and remedy, and the Supplier’s only obligation and liability, in respect of the performance and availability of the Managed Services, or their non-performance and non-availability.]

   Sole and exclusive remedy
 
 states that the Customer’s exclusive remedy under this agreement for the performance or availability of the Managed Services is the Supplier’s compliance with the Service Level Arrangements set out in  (that is, Service Credits). If acting for a Customer, this clause should be amended to state that the Service Level Arrangements are without prejudice to the Customer’s other rights or remedies. Service Credits are used to incentivise the right behaviour in the Supplier, and are unlikely to recompense the Customer adequately for any loss that it may suffer as a result of the Supplier’s failure to provide the Managed Services in accordance with the agreement.

   19.5  Subject to  [and ]:

   (a)  [the Supplier shall not][neither party shall] be liable whether in contract, tort (including for [negligence or] breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise for any loss of profits, loss of business, depletion of goodwill or similar losses, or for any indirect or consequential loss, costs, damages, charges or expenses however arising; and

   (b)  [the Supplier’s][a party’s] total aggregate liability in contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of this agreement shall be limited to [£[AMOUNT] OR the price paid for the Services during the [12] months preceding the date on which the claim arose].

   Exclusions from liability
 
Under , the Supplier excludes all liability for loss of profit or for indirect and consequential loss, and limits its total aggregate liability to a fixed amount. If acting for a Customer,  should be amended to ensure that the Supplier is liable for direct loss of profits.
 
If there is a specific type of risk that the parties can contemplate, it may be sensible to state expressly whether or not the liability for that is included or excluded, and to amend  accordingly. This may be preferable to relying on the inclusion or exclusion of “indirect loss” or “loss of profit”, given the considerable degree of uncertainty and constantly evolving case law about the scope of indirect loss and loss of profit. For example, a new clause might specify that, notwithstanding , the Supplier is (or, alternatively, without prejudice to the generality of clause 19.5(a), the Supplier is not), responsible for the reasonable costs incurred by the Customer in engaging third-party consultants to monitor the Supplier’s performance following a material breach of this agreement. However, if a party anticipates that if it raises a point, it is likely to lose the argument, then it may prefer to leave the agreement silent and to argue the point on the basis of case law if the loss arises in practice.
 
Where the Supplier will be providing services directly to the Customer through one or more affiliates, it would be sensible for the Supplier to consider specifically giving these affiliates the benefit of the limitation of liability provision and amending  accordingly.
 
In this document the Supplier’s liability under  and  is capped, but the Customer’s liability under these clauses is not. If a cap is agreed (see section below) a Customer may reasonably request such a cap be made mutual.
 
You should review your particular agreement to assess which clauses should reasonably be excluded from the limit in  and make any necessary amendments. This will be particularly important when considering each party’s liability for any obligations imposed under data protection legislation (see ) and wider cybersecurity legislation (see ) as regulatory penalties in these areas can be substantial.

   20.  TERM AND TERMINATION

   Term and termination
 
For further guidance on termination, see  and associated drafting notes, including information on the , which came into force on 26 June 2020. See also  and, in particular,  and the commentary around  and .

   20.1  This agreement shall commence on the Effective Date. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with this , this agreement shall continue in force for the Initial Term and shall automatically extend for successive [12] month periods (Extended Term) at the end of the Initial Term and at the end of each Extended Term. Either party may give written notice to the other party, not later than [120] days before the end of the Initial Term or the relevant Extended Term, to terminate this agreement at the end of the then current Initial Term or the relevant Extended Term, as the case may be.

   Initial term and renewals
 
 states that the agreement will continue until the expiry of the Initial Term and thereafter will automatically renew (unless terminated on notice) for successive one year periods. A more Customer-friendly alternative might be that, after the expiry of the Initial Term, the agreement becomes terminable on notice at any time by either party.

   20.2  [Without prejudice to any rights that have accrued under this agreement or any of its rights or remedies and subject to , the Customer may terminate this agreement [at any time [during][after]the Initial Term] on giving not less than [120] days’ written notice to the Supplier, provided that on any such termination it shall, without prejudice to any accrued rights or obligations as at that time, be obliged to pay termination compensation to the Supplier calculated as follows: [DETAILS OF TERMINATION COMPENSATION].]

   Minimum term and termination fee (optional)
 
 is an optional clause that gives the Customer a right to terminate early for “convenience” in return for termination compensation. This is usually achieved by a termination fee (either an amount determined at the time the contract is signed or else one which can be calculated precisely at the time of the early termination). The amount of the fee would normally decrease over time until the end of the initial term, typically on a monthly straight-line basis. The Supplier may also seek to be repaid any costs it has specifically incurred in connection with the set up of the services that it is unable to recoup (sometimes referred to as stranded costs and could include rental payments for property, equipment leases for licences).
 
If acting for the Supplier, consider whether the right to terminate for convenience should be subject to a minimum term and/or the termination fee should become due in the event of termination for any other non-fault based triggers (for example, change of control, benchmarker review and force majeure).
 
If acting for the Customer, consider whether the obligation to pay a termination payment should apply only during the Initial Term.

   20.3  Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it, and subject to , either party may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the other party if:

   Termination rights
 
 sets out circumstances whereby the agreement can be terminated early. This includes where there has been a change of control of the other party (, which is likely to be resisted by a Supplier. The Customer should consider limiting the circumstances in which the Supplier can terminate the agreement to ensure security of tenure.

   (a)  [the other party fails to pay any amount due under this agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than [NUMBER] days after being notified [in writing] to make such payment;]

   (b)  the other party commits a material breach of any [other] term of this agreement and (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of 30 days after being notified [in writing] to do so;

   (e)  the other party commences negotiations with all or any class of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its debts, or makes a proposal for or enters into any compromise or arrangement with any of its creditors [other than (being a company) other than for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (f)  the other party applies to court for, or obtains, a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986;

   (h)  an application is made to court, or an order is made, for the appointment of an administrator, or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given, or an administrator is appointed, over the other party (being a company, partnership or limited liability partnership);

   (j)  a person becomes entitled to appoint a receiver over all or any of the assets of the other party or a receiver is appointed over all or any of the assets of the other party;

   (k)  a creditor or encumbrancer of the other party attaches or takes possession of, or a distress, execution, sequestration or other such process is levied or enforced on or sued against, the whole or any part of the other party’s assets and such attachment or process is not discharged within 14 days;

   (l)  any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the other party in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events mentioned in  to  (inclusive);

   (m)  the other party suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business;

   (p)  any warranty given by the other party in clause [NUMBER] of this agreement is found to be untrue or misleading.

   20.4  For the purposes of , a material breach means :

   (a)  a breach of any of the obligations set out in clauses [NUMBERS]; or

   (b)  a breach that has a serious effect on the benefit the terminating party would otherwise derive from this agreement [over any [NUMBER]-month period during its term].

   20.5  Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it, and subject to :

   (a)  the Customer may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the Supplier if:

   (i)  the Supplier commits a series of breaches of this agreement which are each individually not material but which occur sufficiently often within a sufficiently short period to have, in aggregate, the effect of being a material breach; or

   (ii)  the Supplier breaches any of the terms of  or ; or

   (b)  the Customer may terminate this agreement in accordance with [ or] .

   Termination for errors during set up phase
 
The reference to  in  and  are alternatives, depending on whether the right to terminate if an Error cannot be fixed during the Set-Up Service is mutual () or exercisable only by the Customer (). See further, .

   20.6  The party not affected by a continuing Force Majeure Event may terminate this agreement in accordance with .

   20.7  [Either party may terminate this agreement in accordance with .]

   20.8  Any provision of this agreement which expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after expiry or termination of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

   20.9  Expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason shall not affect the accrued rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties existing at expiry or termination.

   20.10  On expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason:

   (a)  the Supplier shall immediately cease provision of the Set-Up Services, Managed Services and Maintenance Services but [shall OR may] provide Transition Services for a further period in accordance with ;

   (b)  (subject to ) each party shall return and make no further use of any equipment, property, materials and other items (and all copies of them) belonging to the other party and the Customer shall cease to use any IP address licensed to the Customer by the Supplier pursuant to ; and

   (c)  if the Supplier receives, no later than ten days after the effective date of the expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason, a written request for the delivery to the Customer of the most recent backup of the Customer Data, the Supplier shall [use commercially reasonable endeavours to] deliver the backup to the Customer within [30] days of its receipt of such a written request in the format stored or in a format as otherwise reasonably requested by the Customer, provided that the Customer has at that time paid all fees and charges outstanding at (and including any resulting from) expiry or termination (whether or not due at the date of expiry or termination). Once such ten-day period has expired or the Supplier has, at the Customer’s request, delivered to the Customer the most recent backup of the Customer Data (as applicable), the Supplier shall (subject to ) promptly expunge from the Supplier’s System and otherwise destroy or dispose of all of the Customer Data in its possession or control[. The Customer shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Supplier in returning and disposing of Customer Data and expunging it from the Supplier’s System].

   20.11  If a party is required by any law, regulation, or government or regulatory body (Regulatory Requirement) to retain any documents or materials which it would otherwise be obliged to return or destroy under , it shall notify the other party in writing of such retention, giving details of the documents or materials that it must retain.  shall continue to apply to any such retained documents and materials for as long as any such requirement continues in force, subject to any disclosure mandated by any Regulatory Requirement.

   Retention of records for regulatory reasons
 
If either party operates in a regulated industry it may need to preserve records to comply with regulatory obligations.

   20.12  The Supplier shall be considered to have satisfied its obligation to “expunge” or “destroy” or “dispose” of any electronic data, for the purposes of , where it puts such electronic data beyond use.

   Deletion of electronic data
 
It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to delete electronic data. The word ‘deletion’, and its variants, can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK’s data protection authority) has opined that the term “deletion”, in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.

   21.  EXIT ASSISTANCE AND TRANSFER OF ASSETS

   Exit assistance and transfer of Assets
 
This clause sets up a simple process where the Supplier is obliged, within six months of the start of the contract, to prepare an exit plan setting out how the services will be transitioned at the end of the contract. The Supplier is entitled to charge an additional fee for this assistance. Customers may want the Supplier to produce this exit plan as part of the Set-up Services. In addition, Customers should agree the charges payable in respect of the Transition Services before signing the contract.
 
The parties should also consider whether the Supplier should be required to maintain an asset register during the term of the agreement.

   21.1  The Supplier shall, on request from the Customer [at any time after the expiry of six months from the Acceptance Date], prepare or update a detailed plan for the orderly transition of the Services from the Supplier to the Customer’s nominated Replacement Supplier (Exit Plan).

   21.2  The Customer may, at any time before expiry or termination of all or any part of this agreement for any reason request the Supplier to provide the Transition Services or otherwise to offer reasonable assistance in transitioning the Services to a Replacement Supplier (by providing the Transition Services). The Supplier shall[, in consideration of a reasonable fee (to be agreed in advance),] provide such Transition Services for a maximum period of [three] months, or until expiry or termination of all or any part of this agreement for any reason in accordance with , whichever is later.

   Fault-related termination
 
If acting for the Customer, consider whether when terminating as a result of some fault-related termination triggers, the Customer should be required to pay for the Transition Services, however it should be taken into account that the standard of the services and assistance is likely to reflect the amount paid for the same.

   21.3  On expiry or termination of all or any part of this agreement for any reason the Supplier [shall promptly produce a list of the Customer-site Equipment and the Transferring Contracts. The Supplier ]shall sell, and the Customer shall buy, the Customer-site Equipment for net book value, calculated in accordance with Supplier’s reasonable then-current depreciation policy. Title to such Customer-site Equipment shall pass to the Customer on the Supplier’s receipt of payment for the same.

   Purchase of customer-side equipment
 
Under , the Supplier will, on expiry or termination, produce a list of equipment on the Customer’s premises and contracts that are to be transferred back to the Customer. The clause continues that the Supplier will sell these things and the Customer will buy them for net book value. This clause gives the Customer no discretion as to whether to buy these, and therefore there may be some further negotiation on this point. In addition, Customers may want to ensure that this list of equipment and contracts is updated throughout the term of the agreement as part of the Supplier’s obligations. Also, a Customer should consider whether it wants to repurchase any other Hardware acquired by the Supplier, and consider procedures concerning the return of Customer Data. See .

   21.4  [The Supplier and Customer shall co-operate to procure the novation or assignment to the Replacement Supplier of the Transferring Contracts.]

   21.5  The Customer shall:

   (a)  accept assignments from the Supplier or join with the Supplier in procuring a novation of each Transferring Contract (as applicable); and

   (b)  once a Transferring Contract is novated or assigned to the Replacement Supplier, carry out, perform and discharge all the obligations and liabilities created by or arising under that Transferring Contract and exercise its rights arising under that Transferring Contract or, as applicable, procure that any third party Replacement Supplier does the same.

   Transferring contracts
 
Customers should consider amending  to impose an explicit obligation on the Supplier to include in any underlying contract it enters into under the agreement provisions that allows for that contract to be transferred or novated to the Customer. Further, the Supplier should indemnify the Customer before and after the transfer in respect of any liabilities arising from the Supplier’s performance and discharge of its obligations under any contracts transferred or novated and the condition of the Assets.

   22.  FORCE MAJEURE

   Force majeure
 
This is a fairly standard force majeure clause. It is expressed to be mutual but will primarily benefit the Supplier as the party with the majority of the obligations likely to be impacted by force majeure. However, a force majeure clause may still benefit a Customer for instance if it unable to perform a Customer dependency (although failure to perform dependencies often just relieves a Supplier of liability for a related obligation it cannot perform rather than the Customer being liable for its non-performance; a mutual force majeure clause can entitle the Customer to terminate the agreement too). The definition of  does expressly include industrial relations disputes involving the workforce of either party, but this may be resisted by Customers on the basis the Supplier should have avoided this with better industrial relations management and its inclusion is unlikely to benefit the Customer.
 
For an alternative clause, and further consideration of force majeure provisions, see . See also, .

   22.1  Neither party shall have any liability to the other under this agreement if it is prevented from, or delayed in, performing its obligations under this agreement, arising from any Force Majeure Event, provided that:

   (a)  the other party is notified of such an event and its expected duration; and

   (b)  it uses all reasonable endeavours to mitigate, overcome or minimise the effects of the Force Majeure Event concerned,

   and that if the period of delay or non-performance continues for [NUMBER] [weeks OR months] or more, the party not affected may terminate this agreement by giving not less than [14 days’] written notice to the other party.

   22.2  [If the Force Majeure Event results in the suspension of all or any part of the Services, then the Customer shall not be obliged to pay the relevant Fees until such time as the Force Majeure Event shall have ceased to have effect and the Services recommence in accordance with this agreement.]

   22.3  The Supplier shall have in place an appropriate Disaster Recovery Plan to ensure that it is able to comply with its obligations under this agreement and shall maintain, update and test such Disaster Recovery Plan and notify full details of its then current Disaster Recovery Plan to the Customer no less frequently than every 12 months. [If such Disaster Recovery Plan is invoked, the cost and expense of invoking and executing such Disaster Recovery Plan shall be borne by the Supplier.

   23.  AUDIT

   Audit
 
This clause sets out an audit obligation whereby the Supplier is obliged to allow the Customer to confirm compliance with its obligations under the contract. Generally in a managed services arrangement, the service is provided almost as a “black box”, that is, the Customer should have little need to see granular detail of exactly how the service is being provided. Nevertheless, it may be useful to have some provision like this, for example to ensure compliance with security policies or obligations in respect of Customer Data as set out in . In situations where audit is more important, Customers can ask for further provisions here, for example a mechanism to claw back audit costs if an audit reveals a breach of contract by the Supplier. The Supplier may want to limit the number and frequency of audits which (notwithstanding ) can be disruptive, in which case the Customer may want to remove or vary such limits if an audit reveals a breach of contract. If access is required by the Customer to the Supplier’s premises, the Supplier may require this to be escorted access and to public areas only.
 
An obligation on the Supplier to provide frequent financial and management information to the Customer may help meet any Customer or regulatory concerns about the Supplier’s continued solvency during periods of economic stress, particularly if the Services are very important to the Customer. Key events regarding such services may fall within the scope of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Broadly speaking, companies affected by SOX include not only US companies, but also:
 
EU subsidiaries of US parents (where consolidated).
Non-US companies that have securities publicly traded in the US on national securities exchanges.
NASDAQ companies that file reports under section 15(d) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or that have registered securities under the US Securities Act of 1933.
Under SOX, all material changes must be disclosed “on a rapid and current basis” (known as real-time disclosure). The  or  is directly responsible for the internal controls of the company, including the IT systems, and the sanctions for non-compliance include up to 20 years in jail and a $5 million fine. If acting for the Supplier, do not include  or the optional text in  that refers to SOX in your initial draft.
 
For periods ending on or after 15 June 2011, a public company Customer subject to SOX should review at a minimum the Supplier’s  Service Organization Control 1 (SOC 1) Type II report, or if not available, the information that would be required by the management of the Supplier in connection with producing that report.
 
SSAE 16 was drafted to comply with the relevant standards of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), in particular International Standards for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402.
 
In every case, the Customer should check with its audit function which appropriate audit standard should be referred to and complied with in this clause.

   23.1  For the term of this agreement, and for a period of [seven] years from expiry or termination of this agreement for any reason, the Supplier shall maintain full and accurate records [in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles], in an agreed form, of all charges, prices, costs and expenses associated with and invoiced in respect of the Services [and its performance against the Service Level Arrangements] and all processing of data under this agreement.

   23.2  [For the term of this agreement, the Supplier shall ensure that monthly management accounts are produced in addition to its annual audited accounts and shall, if requested, promptly provide to the Customer copies of such records and accounts and any other financial information reasonably requested by the Customer.]

   23.3  The Supplier shall, on reasonable advance written notice:

   (a)  allow the Customer, any designated auditors of, or other advisers to, the Customer, and any regulators of the Customer to access any of the Supplier’s (and any of the Supplier’s sub-contractors’) premises, personnel, relevant records and systems used by the Supplier (or any of its sub-contractors) in the provision of the Services (including the Supplier’s System and its (or any of its sub-contractors’) data processing facilities) as may be reasonably required to verify that the Services are being provided in accordance with this agreement and the adequacy of the Supplier’s (and any of the Supplier’s sub-contractors’) financial standing[ ; and

   (b)  provide to the Customer and the auditors of the Customer the report of the auditor of the Supplier (and any relevant sub-contractor) under SSAE 16 (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16, published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)), which auditor’s report shall be at a minimum an SOC 1 (Service Organization Control 1) Type II report or, if such a SOC 1 Type II report is not available, the information that would be required by the management of the Supplier (or relevant sub-contractor) in connection with producing that report].

   23.4  The Customer shall use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the conduct of each audit does not unreasonably disrupt the Supplier (or any of its sub-contractors) or delay the provision of any of the Services by the Supplier. [Any audit shall be conducted during business hours and no more than once in each 12 month period of the Term.]

   23.5  Subject to the Customer’s obligations of confidentiality, the Supplier shall provide (and procure that its sub-contractors provide) the Customer (and its auditors and other advisers) with all reasonable co-operation, access and assistance in relation to each audit.

   23.6  The parties shall bear their own costs and expenses incurred in respect of compliance with their obligations under this clause.

   24.  ANTI-BRIBERY [AND ANTI-SLAVERY POLICY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING]

   Anti-bribery
 
For more information about the Bribery Act 2010 and its application, see .
 
See also the drafting notes to .

   24.1  The Supplier shall:

   (a)  comply with all applicable laws, statutes [,][and] regulations[ and codes] relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 (Relevant Requirements);

   (b)  [not engage in any activity, practice or conduct that would constitute an offence under sections 1, 2 or 6 of the Bribery Act 2010 if such activity, practice or conduct had been carried out in the UK;]

   (c)  comply with the Customer’s Ethics, Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption Policies (annexed to this agreement at ) and [RELEVANT INDUSTRY CODE ON ANTI-BRIBERY] [annexed to this agreement at ], in each case as the Customer or the relevant industry body may update them from time to time (Relevant Policies);

   (d)  have and maintain in place throughout the term of this agreement its own policies and procedures, including adequate procedures under the Bribery Act 2010, to ensure compliance with the Relevant Requirements[, the Relevant Policies] [and ], and shall enforce them where appropriate;

   (e)  promptly report to the Customer any request or demand for any undue financial or other advantage of any kind received by the Supplier in connection with the performance of this agreement;

   (f)  immediately notify the Customer (in writing) if a foreign public official [becomes an officer or employee of the Supplier AND/OR acquires a direct or indirect interest in the Supplier] (and the Supplier warrants and represents that it has no foreign public officials as [officers or employees AND/OR direct or indirect owners] at the date of this agreement);

   (g)  within [NUMBER] months of the date of this agreement, and annually thereafter, certify to the Customer in writing signed by an officer of the Supplier, compliance with this  by the Supplier and all persons associated with it and all other persons for whom the Supplier is responsible under . The Supplier shall provide such supporting evidence of compliance as the Customer may reasonably request.

   24.2  The Supplier shall ensure that any person associated with the Supplier or who is otherwise performing services [or providing goods] in connection with this agreement does so only on the basis of a written contract that imposes on and secures from such person terms equivalent to those imposed on the Supplier in this  (Relevant Terms). The Supplier shall be responsible for the observance and performance by such persons of the Relevant Terms, and shall be directly liable to the Customer for any breach by such persons of any of the Relevant Terms.

   Supply chain issues
 
On a strict construction of the BA 2010 definition of associated person, the Supplier’s own associated persons (essentially any person performing services for or on behalf of the Supplier who may (without limitation) be one of the Supplier’s own employees, agents, subsidiaries, sub-contractors or suppliers) may also be associated persons of the Customer. Consequently, bribery by these persons would result in liability for the Customer, unless the Customer can demonstrate that it has put adequate procedures in place to prevent such bribery.
 
However, the BA 2010 Guidance (Guidance about procedures which relevant commercial organisations can put in place to prevent persons associated with them from bribing (section 9 of the Bribery Act 2010), published by the Ministry of Justice) suggests that where a supply chain involves several entities, or a project is to be performed by a prime contractor with a series of sub-contractors, a commercial organisation is only likely to exercise control over its relationship with its direct contractual counterparty (paragraph 39, BA 2010 Guidance). Indeed, the organisation may only know the identity of its direct contractual counterparty, and not those further down the supply chain. In this situation, according to the guidance, it is likely that persons who contract with that counterparty will be performing services for the counterparty and not for other persons in the contractual chain (that is, the ultimate Customer), suggesting that the Customer will not be liable for bribery committed by its Supplier’s sub-contractors.
 
The BA 2010 Guidance recommends that the principal way in which commercial organisations may approach bribery risks that arise as a result of a supply chain is by employing the anti-bribery procedures as proposed in the BA 2010 Guidance (for example, risk-based due diligence and the use of anti-bribery terms and conditions) in its relationship with its contractual counterparty and requesting that the counterparty adopt a similar approach with the next person in the chain. This is the approach adopted by the proposed .
 
Given the non-prescriptive nature of the BA 2010 Guidance, in certain circumstances such as high-profile transactions or in high-risk jurisdictions or sectors or where the Customer has itself selected the sub-contractors and the Supplier is merely acting as the prime contractor for logistical reasons, the Customer may want to implement additional safeguards. For more prescriptive supply chain clauses, and additional safeguards to those recommended in the BA 2010 Guidance, see .
 
For a discussion of supply chain issues, see .

   24.3  [In relation to this agreement and/or its subject matter, neither the Supplier nor any of its employees, sub-contractors, agents or suppliers or others performing services (in any capacity) for or on behalf of the Supplier in connection with the subject matter of this agreement (each an Associated Person) has done (or agreed to do) or shall do (or agree to do) anything which constitutes a breach by either party or any Associated Person of any Relevant Requirements [or would constitute a breach by either party or any Associated Person of any Relevant Requirements if [the Supplier] or such Associated Person had a close connection with the United Kingdom as defined in s.12(4) of the Bribery Act 2010].]

   24.4  [The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that it has been provided with a copy of the Customer’s ethics and anti-corruption codes, policies and procedures as at the date of this agreement and undertakes that it shall (and shall procure that its Associated Persons shall) throughout the term of this agreement comply with, monitor and enforce such codes, policies and procedures, and any update to such codes, policies and/or procedures as is notified to the Supplier in writing from time to time. The Customer shall give the Supplier reasonable notice of any changes to such codes, policies and procedures.]

   24.5  [The Supplier shall (and shall procure that its Associated Persons shall) promptly co-operate with the Customer and/or any regulator and/or prosecutor in any investigation relating to any breach, or alleged breach, of any Relevant Requirements by the Supplier or any of its Associated Persons.]

   24.6  For the purpose of this , the meaning of adequate procedures and foreign public official and whether a person is associated with another person shall be determined in accordance with section 7(2) of the Bribery Act 2010 (and any guidance issued under section 9 of that Act), section 6(5) and (6) of that Act, and section 8 of that Act respectively. For the purposes of this  a person associated with the Supplier also includes any sub-contractor of the Supplier.

   Definitions
 
For more information on the significance of adequate procedures and associated persons, see .

   24.7  [In performing its obligations under this agreement the [Supplier OR Customer] shall [comply with the Slavery Policy OR:

   Compliance with slavery policy
 
This clause can be used where the Customer or Supplier has specific business policies and wants to ensure that the other party complies with them. The policies might reflect a party’s legal obligations, for instance, under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Bribery Act 2010 or applicable data protection legislation. Alternatively, a party may have adopted business social responsibility policies voluntarily.
 
In most goods or services agreements, the obligation is usually on the Supplier to comply with the Customer’s policies. But this may not always be the case: depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, a Supplier may well require the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s policies instead. As this is a pro-supplier agreement, the Supplier may want to omit this clause altogether from the first draft provided to the Customer.
 
If the Supplier does choose to include this clause, there are two drafting options:
 
The first is a requirement on the Customer to comply with the Supplier’s policies. This is slightly unusual (the usual position is that a Supplier agrees to comply with the Customer’s policies), but a Supplier who is concerned about its reputation may well want to ensure that it is only supplying goods or services to Customers who are willing to comply with the Supplier’s policies on issues such as anti-bribery, modern slavery and ethics.
The second option is a requirement on the Supplier to comply with the Customer’s policies. This is the more usual approach in a goods or services agreement. A Supplier may include this option if, for instance, it has already agreed in principle that it is able to comply with the Customer’s policies, or the parties already have an ongoing relationship where the Supplier is comfortable with complying with the Customer’s policies.
Whatever approach is taken, check that the definition of above is consistent with the approach in this clause.
 
Note also that if the Customer agrees to comply with the Supplier’s policies, the Supplier may want a subsequent right to terminate the agreement if the Customer breaches those policies. If this is desired, the Supplier could include this additional right to terminate at . For an example of this, see .

## Schedule 4 – SCHEDULE 4

   MANAGED SERVICES SPECIFICATION

   Managed Services Specification
 
This Schedule should contain details of the services that are to be provided. Examples of some of the provisions that may be relevant are set out in square brackets.
 
The descriptions set out below may be high level. Care should be taken to tailor the descriptions to the relevant Services.

   [DESCRIPTION OF THE MANAGED SERVICES, INCLUDING THE SUPPLIER’S SYSTEM AND HARDWARE]

   1.  [INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

   [    The Supplier shall procure, install and configure equipment for use to provide the Services. This includes the rack mounting of servers and related equipment, installation of system and database software components, configuration of clustering and cross-connects, installation of the Software and loading of initial Customer Data.]

   2.  [INTERNET CONNECTIVITY

   2.1  The Supplier shall provide internet connectivity to the Customer. The connectivity shall include multiple, diversely routed high-speed connections, a firewall for security, and a load balancer for traffic management and speed optimisation.

   2.2  The Supplier shall supply burstable bandwidth connectivity services. The connectivity shall include multiple connections and a network operations centre that monitors servers, the network platform and internet access.]

   3.  [SECURITY SERVICES

   [    The Supplier shall provide security services as follows:

   (a)  access to a dedicated hosting facility (Supplier Facility) shall be limited to the authorised Supplier and contracted third-party personnel;

   (b)  the Supplier Facility shall be monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through closed-circuit video surveillance and shall require identification for access; and

   7.  [ADMINISTRATION SERVICES

   [    These services include the installation and administration of additional Hardware, operating systems and other software, and other resources as necessary to maintain the Services.]


## Schedule 5 – SCHEDULE 5

   MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

   Maintenance and support
 
 sets out details of any maintenance service provided by the Supplier, including fault resolution times. The Supplier determines the priority of fault (). The text set out in this Schedule is illustrative only and the parties should decide (for example) whether response / resolution times should also be designated for defects which lead to security vulnerabilities, as well as those which impair performance, and how this should dovetail with the Supplier’s wider responsibilities under .
 
When acting for the Customer, Maintenance Events should be limited to no more than a set number of hours each month, and any maintenance work carried out outside Normal Business Hours should take place at a date and time agreed by the Customer. With regard to the technical support services provided by the Supplier, it may be important to try to ensure that the Customer and the Supplier agree on a fault priority together, with some sort of mechanism for determining any dispute. A possible solution to this problem is to require the Supplier to treat the priority in accordance with the Customer’s own designation, and then allow the Supplier the option of charging the Customer its incremental costs of resolution if formal dispute resolution ultimately finds that the Supplier was correct in the first place.
 
Customers should carefully set out what events or circumstances will and will not be taken into account when calculating the availability of the Managed Services (that is, the up-time service level). For example, the Customer should consider carefully when determining the availability of the Managed Services whether the following should be discounted:
 
Any periods of planned downtime.
Any period during which the Managed Services are not available due to a Force Majeure Event.
Any period when Managed Services are available only at a lower quality.

   1.  TRAINING

   The Supplier shall provide training to such number of employees of the Customer as is specified in, and is otherwise in accordance with, the Project Plan.

   2.  MAINTENANCE EVENTS

   2.1  Maintenance work that may require interruption of the Managed Services (Maintenance Events) shall not [normally] be performed during Normal Business Hours. The Supplier may interrupt the Managed Services outside Normal Business Hours for maintenance provided that it has given the Customer at least [three] days’ advance written notice.

   2.2  Any Maintenance Events that occur during Normal Business Hours, or that occur with less notice than required by , and which were not requested by the Customer, shall be considered downtime for the purpose of service availability measurement. The Supplier shall at all times endeavour to keep any service interruptions to a minimum.

   3.  TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES

   3.1  Should the Customer determine that the Managed Services include a defect, the Customer support representatives in  of  (CSRs) may file error reports or support requests. The Supplier shall provide technical support services only to CSRs.

   3.2  The Supplier shall accept voicemail, e-mail and web form-based incident submittal from CSRs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Supplier shall accept telephone calls for English language telephone support [during Normal Business Hours]. The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to process support requests, issue trouble ticket tracking numbers if necessary, determine the source of the problem and respond to the Customer. The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to respond to and resolve all support requests from CSRs within the time periods specified below, according to priority.

   3.3  The Supplier shall determine the priority of any incident in accordance with the following table.

   Priority

   Description

   Response time

   Target resolution time

   Priority 1

   The entire Managed Services are completely inaccessible. Priority 1 incidents shall be reported by telephone only.

   Within two Normal Business Hours.

   Four Normal Business Hours. Continuous effort after initial response and with Customer co-operation.

   Priority 2

   Operation of the Managed Services is severely degraded, or major components of the Managed Services are not operational and work cannot reasonably continue. Priority 2 incidents shall be reported by telephone only.

   Within four Normal Business Hours.

   Within two Business Days after initial response.

   Priority 3

   Certain non-essential features of the Managed Services are impaired while most major components of the Managed Services remain functional.

   Within 12 Normal Business Hours.

   Within seven Business Days after initial response.

   Priority 4

   Errors that are non-disabling or cosmetic and clearly have little or no impact on the normal operation of the Managed Services.

   Within 24 Normal Business Hours.

   When reasonably possible.

   3.4  If a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident has not been resolved within the target resolution time, the incident shall be escalated to [LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT]. If the incident is not resolved, then after each successive increment of the target resolution time the incident shall be escalated to the [LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT], followed by [LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT], followed by the [President OR CEO].

   3.5  [The Supplier shall provide monitoring of its Managed Services as described in  of , 24 hours a day seven days a week.]

   3.6  The Customer shall provide front-line support to Managed Services users who are not the designated CSRs. The Customer’s designated CSRs may contact Supplier technical support in order to report problems that the Customer’s designated CSRs cannot resolve themselves after they have performed a reasonable level of diagnosis.


## Schedule 6 – SCHEDULE 6

   SERVICE LEVEL ARRANGEMENTS

   Service Level Arrangements
 
Generally with service levels, the availability percentage will be by far the most significant service level. This standard document, therefore, has just this one. Note that the Service Credit entitlement in  is simply a proportional refund of the fees for downtime.
 
Suppliers may sometimes request an “earn-back” for over performance. Text for this provision has not been included in the standard document and is a matter for negotiation, but generally customers will not consider this unless they themselves will receive a benefit from performance on service levels that is better than expected. For example, it may not be appropriate to consider an earn-back for a measure of voice quality (so long as the quality is good enough, the Customer gets little benefit from very high voice quality).
 
It is perfectly possible, depending on the nature of the services, to construct much more complex service levels for each element. Examples might include targets for repair times that vary depending not only on the priority of the fault, but also on the priority of the infrastructure affected, or targets for the number of days between ordering (for example, a new circuit and the date on which that circuit is delivered).
 
Where acting for the Customer: (i) the Supplier should be required to report to the Customer on its performance of the Services on a monthly basis including its performance measured against the Service Levels; and (ii) if the Supplier fails to meet any Service Levels, Service Credits should be automatically applied to the next invoice; the Customer should not have to specifically request payment.

   1.  SERVICE AVAILABILITY

   1.1  The Supplier shall provide at least a [99.5]% uptime service availability level (Uptime Service Level).

   1.2  The Managed Services shall be considered as unavailable only:

   (a)  during periods of Priority 1 or Priority 2 incidents in accordance with  of ; and

   (b)  during periods of unplanned Maintenance in accordance with  of .

   1.3  For the avoidance of doubt, the Managed Services shall not be considered as “unavailable” during Maintenance Events as described in  of , Customer-caused outages or disruptions, or outages or disruptions attributable in whole or in part to Force Majeure Events within the meaning of .

   2.  SERVICE CREDITS

   2.1  If availability falls below the Uptime Service Level in a given calendar month (Service Delivery Failure), the Supplier shall credit the Customer’s account by an amount calculated as the product of the total cumulative downtime (expressed as a proportion of the total possible uptime minutes in the month concerned) and the total monthly Fees owed for that month.

   2.2  [A Service Credit shall not be payable unless the Customer requests it within 40 Business Days of the end of the calendar month in respect of which the Uptime Service Level was not met.] The maximum Service Credit allowable in respect of a given month is limited to [20]% of the total monthly Fee payable for that month.

   2.3  The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this  relating to Service Credits do not operate by way of penalty and are proportionate when considering the Customer’s legitimate interest to avoid any delay in provision of the Services.


## Schedule 7 – SCHEDULE 7

   BENCHMARKING

   Benchmarking
 
In many cases it may be difficult to conduct a meaningful benchmarking exercise if the managed service is highly tailored to a particular Customer. Nevertheless,  includes a fairly even-handed benchmarking provision, which may be used where it is helpful.
 
Consider whether the Benchmarking should take account of the Maintenance as well as the Managed Services.

   1.  INTERPRETATION

   1.1  In addition to the definitions and rules of interpretation in , the definitions and rules of interpretation in this paragraph apply in this Schedule.

   Benchmarked Services: the Managed Services taken as a whole.

   Benchmarker: the independent third party appointed under  of this .

   Comparison Sample: a sample of organisations providing Equivalent Services identified in accordance with  of this .

   Equivalent Services: services that are identical, or similar in all material respects, to the Benchmarked Services (including in terms of scope, specification, volume and quality of performance), are generally available within the UK and are supplied to a customer similar in size to the Customer over a similar period.

   Median Price: in relation to the Equivalent Services provided by a Comparison Sample, the median price of the relevant services over the previous 12-month period. If there are an even-numbered number of organisations in the Comparison Sample then the Median Price shall be the arithmetic mean of the middle two prices.

   1.2  The Benchmarked Services shall be good value if the Fees attributable to the Benchmarked Services are, having regard to the Service Level Arrangements, less than or equal to [110]% of the Median Price for Equivalent Services provided by a Comparison Sample (Good Value).

   2.  PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF BENCHMARK REVIEW

   The purpose of the Benchmark Review shall be to establish whether the Benchmarked Services are Good Value.

   3.  APPOINTMENT OF BENCHMARKER

   3.1  Each Benchmark Review shall be performed by an independent third party appointed by agreement between the parties. [If the parties cannot agree on the independent third party within [NUMBER] Business Days of receipt by the Supplier of the Customer’s written request, then the Benchmarker shall be [CONSULTANTS].]

   3.2  The Supplier has the right, in its absolute discretion, at any time to require the Benchmarker to enter into an appropriate and reasonable confidentiality undertaking directly with it.

   3.3  Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses relating to a Benchmark Review, except that the costs and expenses of the Benchmarker shall be shared equally by the parties.

   3.4  The Benchmarker shall conduct the Benchmark Review by applying the following general principles and criteria:

   (a)  benchmarking shall be carried out in an independent and objective manner;

   (b)  the Benchmarker shall be jointly instructed by the parties;

   (c)  benchmarking shall be truly comparative in respect of the technology, services and service levels;

   (d)  benchmarking shall be structured and undertaken in a way that causes the minimum disruption possible; and

   (e)  immediately following selection of the Benchmarker, the parties and the Benchmarker shall (all acting reasonably and in good faith) agree the general principles and method of benchmarking.

   3.5  The Supplier shall not be deemed to be in breach of this agreement for any failure to perform any obligation under this agreement (nor shall it be liable for Service Credits) where such failure results from any disruption to the Supplier’s performance as a result of disruption caused by the Benchmarker.

   4.  BENCHMARKING PROCESS

   4.1  The instructions to the Benchmarker shall require the Benchmarker to produce, and to send to each party for approval, a draft plan for the Benchmark Review within [NUMBER] Business Days after the date of appointment of the Benchmarker. The plan shall include:

   (a)  a proposed timetable for the Benchmark Review (including for delivery of the Benchmarking Report);

   (b)  a description of the information that the Benchmarker requires each party to provide;

   (c)  a description of the benchmarking methodology to be used; and

   (d)  details of any organisations providing Equivalent Services that the Customer, having consulted with the Supplier (and including any organisations providing Equivalent Services reasonably proposed by the Supplier), proposes should be included within the Comparison Sample.

   4.7  The Benchmarker shall share with the parties, in an even-handed manner, all data relating to the benchmarking and the Benchmarking Report to the extent that it is lawfully able to do so.

   4.8  The selection of the Comparison Sample (both in terms of number and identity of entities) shall be a matter for the Benchmarker’s professional judgment, but such sample shall not include entities providing Equivalent Services in offshore jurisdictions if, and to the extent that, the Supplier is not itself providing the Benchmarked Service offshore.

   4.9  In conducting the Benchmark Review, the Benchmarker shall apply correction factors to the information to take account of reasons for difference in accordance with their professional judgment. Such normalisation information shall be available for approval by the parties before the production of the Benchmarking Report.

   4.10  The Benchmarker shall perform the Benchmark Review in a fully transparent and open manner, and shall promptly provide the Customer and the Supplier with full details of all data and methodologies employed at all stages of the Benchmark Review.

   5.  BENCHMARK REPORT

   5.1  The Benchmarker shall prepare a Benchmark Report setting out its findings. Those findings shall:

   (a)  include a finding as to whether or not the Benchmarked Services are Good Value;

   (b)  include other findings regarding the quality and competitiveness or otherwise of the Services; and

   (c)  if the Benchmarked Services are not Good Value, specify the changes that would be required to the Services, and in particular to the Fees, in order to make the Benchmarked Services Good Value.

## Schedule 12 – SCHEDULE 12

   SUPPLIER’S NETWORK AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY

   Supplier’s network and information systems security
 
The Supplier should include in this Schedule information and policies on how it maintains security on its network and information systems as set out in this Schedule. This is intended to assist the Customer in complying with the NIS Regulations (should these be applicable).
 
RDSPs: The points in the schedule reflect the prescriptive requirements of  which sets out further specification of the elements to be taken into account by RDSPs for managing the risks posed to the security of network and information systems (Article 2), as referenced in  of the NIS Regulations (which transposes Article 16(1) of the NIS Directive). An RDSP must ensure it has adequate documentation to enable the ICO to verify compliance with its security obligations (Article 2(6)). An RDSP has to meet the requirements of Article 2 of the Implementing Regulation.
 
OESs (that are not also RDSPs): The NIS Regulations are less specific about what actions OESs should take to ensure network and information systems security, the main requirement being for them to take appropriate and proportionate measures (). However, the relevant regulator for the sector in which the OES operates may have published more specific guidance and OESs must have regard to such guidance (regulation 10(4)) as well as the NCSC guidance. The NCSC guidance should be considered, in particular:  and .
 
Those parts of the guidance referred to in ,  and .
 
However, the NCSC guidance is principles and outcomes-based and in fact states: “Consider setting different protection requirements for different types of contracts, based on the risk associated with them: avoid situations where you force all your suppliers to deliver the same set of security requirements when it may not be proportionate or justified to do so.”
 
OESs should consider whether any guidance from the relevant competent authority impacts on the information they might want from the Supplier in this schedule.
 
Banking and financial market infrastructures sectors: These sectors were omitted from the NIS Regulations although they fall within the Cybersecurity Directive. As well as the NCSC guidance, they will have to consider any relevant sectoral guidance. See Drafting note, Reporting security incidents to regulators under clause 8.7(a).
 
Other sectors: The points in the schedule are generically worded and so could be used where the customer is in a sector other than one of those referred to above. However, where the customer is not a RDSP, the Supplier may resist providing all the information set out in this schedule. In any case, these points should be seen as initial points for discussion. The NCSC guidance, even though focused on OESs only, might also be useful during negotiations.
