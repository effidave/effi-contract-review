### Comment 1
**Author:** David Sant | **Date:** 2025-12-05T10:20:00+00:00

**Author:** David Sant | **Date:** 2025-12-05T10:23:00+00:00

> For [CLIENT]: For a trial licence I normally remove warranties and indemnities and fall back to “as is”.  This largely depends on whether you are being paid / how much you are being paid.  From your email, I infer that you are prepared to accept some liability.

**Referenced text:** "Specifications.  Vendor will use reasonable efforts to cause the Vendor IP to perform or otherwise comply in all material respects in accordance with any specifications related to the Vendor IP provided to Company or otherwise made publicly available."

Vendor acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Vendor’s rights herein, Company retains all right, title and interest, including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to any items and materials it (directly or indirectly) provides to Vendor, inputs into the Vendor’s service or which Vendor otherwise collects or generates (including as an output) on behalf Company (“NBCU Data”).
