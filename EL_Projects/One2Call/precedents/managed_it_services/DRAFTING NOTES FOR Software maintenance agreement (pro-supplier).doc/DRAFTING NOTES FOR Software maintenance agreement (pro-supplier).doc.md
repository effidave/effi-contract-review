# DRAFTING NOTES FOR Software maintenance agreement (pro-supplier)

by Practical Law IP&IT

Standard documents | Maintained | United Kingdom

Specimen agreement for the provision of maintenance services by the supplier of the relevant software, drafted so as to highlight provisions which may be desirable from the supplier’s point of view.

With thanks to Iain Monaghan.

About this document
 
This standard document is to be used for the maintenance and support of complex  designed for business rather than consumer use.
 
The standard document is drafted from the supplier’s perspective. However, it adopts a reasonably balanced approach to the relevant issues because an agreement which is drafted too much in favour of either party serves only to increase the time and cost of negotiations. A separate standard document is available when acting for the customer (see .
 
The main issues arising from software maintenance contracts are discussed in . This drafting note is designed to be read in conjunction with that practice note.
  
Legal issues
 
 
Assumptions
 
The standard document is drafted on the following assumptions:
 
The supported software is on-premises software, rather than SaaS. While it could be used as a basis for a maintenance agreement for , typically the level and quality of support should be higher in a SaaS set-up than in ordinary customer support and maintenance arrangements and most public cloud systems operate as a “permanent beta”, meaning that there are no manually provided versions of the software in the traditional sense. As new functionality is added or bugs are fixed, these are incorporated into the online application. This means that the application being accessed through a web browser is always the most up to date without the need for costly upgrades, and so various obligations set out in this agreement (for, example, relating to the provision of Maintenance Releases in ) will not apply. See .
The customer does not own any rights in the software (it uses the software under a licence). See .
Maintenance is being provided by the owner of the rights in the software. See .
The parties (which are both UK limited companies). are dealing with each other in the course of their respective businesses. This means that the UK rules protecting consumers will not apply. (For more information on those rules, see .) Note that this agreement should not be used in a business-to-consumer transaction. Consumer software does not normally need to be supported; upgrades are usually offered under the customer’s licence (and made available for download from the supplier’s website), and sometimes a telephone helpline is provided for queries.
No employees are intended to transfer as part of the provision of maintenance services, and the  (TUPE) do not apply. If there is a risk that TUPE applies, then this should be considered carefully and the agreement amended to reflect the risk, see .
The standard document does not extend to hardware maintenance. For a specimen agreement that deals with hardware maintenance, see .
 
Rights in software
 
It is increasingly common for maintenance to be provided by third parties who do not own any rights in the software. The maintenance of software requires a licence from the software owner (or an authorised licensee with rights to sub-license) in the same way that use of the software must be licensed. Consequently, the maintainer needs to ensure either that it has an agreement with the software owner granting it the necessary rights (for example, as part of its appointment as an approved maintenance company), or that the customer is entitled to allow the maintainer to carry out work on the customer’s behalf.
 
Except where the customer is itself the software owner, it is unlikely that the customer will have the rights or information necessary to enable the maintainer to perform all its obligations under this standard document (at the very least, the maintainer will require access to the software owner in order to resolve technical issues), so an agreement between the software owner and the maintainer is likely to be required. To the extent that the supplier relies on the customer’s rights it should request an indemnity from the customer in case those rights prove to be illusory.
 
Although a maintenance agreement for on-premises software generally includes an obligation on the maintainer to provide new releases and versions of the software (referred to in the standard document as Modifications), the maintenance agreement will not usually deal with the customer’s right to use those modifications. In other words, it does not constitute a licence of the software modifications. The standard document is drafted on the assumption that this right is contained in the licence under which the customer is given the right to use the software (referred to in the standard document as the Licence). If this were not the case, the maintenance agreement could be drafted to bring the modifications within the scope of that licence. However, where the maintainer is not the owner of the rights in the software, it is unlikely to have the rights to license the use of the modifications; its licence will normally be limited to supplying the media on which those modifications are recorded. In order to prevent it incurring any liability in those cases, a third-party maintainer should, before signature, satisfy itself that the customer does have a licence to use the modifications to the software which the maintainer has an obligation to provide.
 
Limits of liability
 
The supplier should seek to limit its liability to the customer under the maintenance agreement as, otherwise, it could face liability which far exceeds the sums it receives under the agreement if it is unable to provide an adequate level of service. Customers will usually accept some form of exclusion and limitation of liability, but suppliers need to draft such terms carefully so that they comply with the provisions of the  (UCTA), where this applies, see . See also .
 
Off-shoring
 
The specimen agreement assumes that the contract will be performed in the UK. However, most maintenance services can now be provided remotely so suppliers will often wish to subcontract performance to individuals situated off-shore (for example, in India). These individuals may be employees of the supplier but will more likely be employees of a subsidiary or subcontractor. From a customer’s point of view this potentially gives rise to a number of concerns, including:
 
Data protection. The wording of both the  (and where it applies, the ) is broad, and an off-shore engineer who accesses a UK system containing personal data for maintenance purposes may carry out operations that could be considered to constitute transferring personal data outside the UK. Unless there is to be an absolute prohibition on any processing being carried out off-shore, the parties will need to consider how transfers of personal data out of the UK (and where EU legislation applies, the EU) can be undertaken in compliance with the relevant data protection legislation. For more information on this topic see .
Security. As part of any risk assessment for security purposes the supplier will wish to consider the procedures it has in place to protect unauthorised access to data, screen its employees for security purposes, prevent removal of data from customer systems, and so on. The supplier will then need to consider whether this security risk is being managed in line with any statutory or contractual obligations the supplier is under in relation to data protection or cybersecurity more generally, see  and .
Reputation. All suppliers who send services off-shore need to consider whether the manner in which their off-shore suppliers carry on business is consistent with their ethical and environmental standards. Many large off-shore vendors in the IT industry are only too aware of these concerns and are able to demonstrate high levels of compliance to their customers, but a supplier whose maintenance contract may include off-shore support (and many will) should consider these issues.
 
Anti-bribery
 
Both customers and suppliers need to comply with the  (BA 2010). However, whether or not to include appropriate anti-bribery clauses in the relevant agreement is primarily an issue for the customer, rather than the supplier, to consider. The customer may be liable under  of the BA 2010 for failure to prevent bribery by or on behalf of the supplier and inclusion of appropriate clauses may help it establish the defence that it has adequate procedures in place designed to prevent bribery by its associated persons. The supplier will not generally face a similar risk on account of the customer’s activities. Nevertheless, the supplier will, for example, need to consider whether to include appropriate clauses in any related subcontract or consultancy agreement which it may enter into for the acquisition of services or goods. For more information, see Practice note,  .

Supply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking
 
The  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. Including anti-slavery and trafficking obligations in its contracts (through business policies or otherwise) is one of the steps an organisation can take.
 
The supplier should note that the customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour. For example, by stating that the supplier will comply with the customer’s policy on slavery (and possibly its other business policies too such as anti-bribery and corruption and data protection and security). But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the supplier may require the customer to comply with the supplier’s business policies for reputational reasons, for example. The outcome of such negotiations would ultimately depend on the parties and how keen each of them wants to do the transaction.
 
For further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .
 
Data protection
 
Where  will be processed under this agreement, the parties will need to consider the impact of any applicable data protection legislation and, where appropriate, suitable data protection clauses will need to be inserted at  or, alternatively, as part of a data protection schedule to be annexed to this agreement.
 
The clauses which are appropriate to include, in each case, will depend upon the relationship of the parties, the context of the processing, and the capacity in which each party processes the personal data.
 
For some specimen personal data processing clauses designed for use in an IT agreement, see:
 
.
.
Each set of clauses provide alternative options to cater for different processing scenarios.
 
For a note setting out the key issues to address when considering the impact of the UK and EU data protection legislation on rights and obligations commonly found in IT contracts, see .
 
Cybersecurity
 
Cybersecurity obligations are becoming more prominent in IT agreements, including as statutory controls and obligations in relation to network and information system, and data, security are increasing, see:
 
;
:
.
For more information on conducting cybersecurity risk assessments, see  and for more information about managing cyber risk in an organisation’s supply chain, see .
 
 
NIS Regulations
The predominant cybersecurity legislation to consider is the  (NIS Regulations), which came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the ) (also known as the Network and Information Systems, or NIS Directive).
 
They have potential impact on:
 
Any operator of essential services that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure (OES).
Relevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)).
For a definition of an OES see  and for a definition of an RDSP see .
 
Like the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems. In practice, however, the two regimes are inextricably linked.
 
OESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OESs).
 
You will need to assess whether your agreement is affected by the NIS Regulations, either directly, because one of the parties falls within the scope of the NIS Regulations, or indirectly, because your agreement is further up a supply chain that includes an entity within the scope of those regulations.
 
During maintenance the customer and supplier systems are likely to interface with each other. The supplier is likely to have access to personal data (for example, customer data) stored on the customer systems at some point. Data will likely flow in both directions and a significant security breach will have compliance consequences under both the UK GDPR (if the data in question is personal data) and the NIS Regulations (if the customer is an OES or RDSP).
 
In that case, the customer may ask for a warranty in relation to the supplier’s network security levels, and in relation to its cooperation in relation to the customer’s regulatory obligations and any security incident. An example of the types of clauses the customer might ask for is set out in , including in . It might be reasonable to agree to such provisions, and in fact the supplier may have developed comprehensive processes and policies to support the services it provides (particularly if it is subject to the NIS Regulations as an RDSP itself). However, the supplier should in return ask for a warranty or some form of approval that the information the supplier provides is sufficient for the customer to meet its obligations under the NIS Regulations.
 
The National Cyber Security Centre has published  which includes advice on how to pass obligations up the supply chain and what considerations should be made in different circumstances.
 
There may also be specific guidance issued by the regulator for the specific OES sector or, for RDSPs, the ICO.
 
For more information on regulation in this area, see 
 
TUPE
 
There is a possibility that a  transfer could occur at the end of a maintenance agreement. This could arise where the support and maintenance services are taken in-house or are re-tendered to a different supplier. Whether there is a risk of TUPE applying is highly fact dependant and would involve a consideration of the usual aspects of the test for a service provision change (see ). One of the key questions is likely to be whether the activities to be carried out following the end of this agreement will be fundamentally the same as those carried out under this agreement (see ). It will also be relevant to consider whether certain of the maintenance staff have been dedicated wholly or substantially to supporting the customer in question (see ). The customer will likely want to insert TUPE clauses which deal with the position on exit. From the customer’s perspective, the exit provisions are intended to anticipate the future commercial considerations and the position of a subsequent supplier (with a view to extending protections to a subsequent supplier). The supplier, on the hand, is likely to seek entry provisions to deal with the risk of a TUPE transfer on entry
 
The form of the clauses and the context is very much the same as found in outsourcing agreements and, accordingly, they have not been replicated in this standard document.
 
For more information, see  and  which have a slightly pro-customer leaning, but the provisions should be reviewed in detail, with reference to the drafting notes, to suit the circumstances.
  
Negotiating and drafting issues
 
The standard document has been drafted to accompany the following Standard documents:
 
.
.
It could also form Appendix B to either of these documents.
 
 
Standardised services
 
The standard document may be used as the supplier’s standard maintenance contract or on a one-off basis for a particular customer. Where it is the supplier’s standard, changes to the scope of the services should be resisted since it might be difficult for the supplier to manage its obligations where they vary from customer to customer.
 
Service levels and service credits
 
Service levels have been included within the standard document as many service obligations are difficult to define without reference to a particular level of service, for example, a two hour response time. Service credits, however, have been omitted from the standard document. (If required by the customer, they can be found in , and there is also a more detailed discussion of service credits in .) The supplier should consider carefully whether to include service credits in a standard form. There are two main reasons why the inclusion of the supplier’s own scheme might be advisable:
 
If it does not include a service credits regime, the customer may include its own, less favourable, scheme.
Customers will often agree that service credits are the customer’s exclusive remedy for the faults they cover and, provided the service credits are at a reasonable level, this can be more beneficial to the supplier than a claim for damages at large.
This second consideration is particularly applicable where the maintenance provider is also the licensor under a separate licence. In the absence of an easy claim under a service credit regime, a disgruntled customer may consider launching a more significant claim under the licence and/or maintenance agreement.

BACKGROUND

(A)The Supplier has supplied and licensed certain software products to the Customer under the terms of the Licence (defined below) and has agreed to provide support and maintenance for such Software [(and other software products)] on the terms set out in this agreement.

AGREED TERMS

1.  INTERPRETATION

Interpretation
 
For more information on interpretation clauses and an alternative wording, see .

1.1  The definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in this agreement [and the schedules to it].

Affiliate:  [includes, in relation to either party, each and any subsidiary or holding company of that party and each and any subsidiary of a holding company of that party OR either party or any business entity from time to time Controlling, Controlled by, or under Common control with, either party].

Business Day:  a day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in England, when banks in London are open for business.

Business Hours:  the period from [9.00 am to 5.00 pm] on any Business Day.

Charges:  the charges payable for the Services under this agreement, being (where the context so requires) each or any of the following:

**a.** the charges for the Standard Support Service set out in  of Schedule 2 (which charges also include the Updating Service);

**b.** the charges for the Enhanced Support Service set out in  of Schedule 3;

**c.** any charges agreed for Optional Services;

**d.** any charges agreed for New Versions; and

**e.** where any of the above have been replaced by Legacy Fees, the Legacy Fees[,

   in each case as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of ].

   Commencement Date:  has the meaning given to it in .

   Confidential Information:  has the meaning given in .

   [Contract Year:  any 12-month period ending on any anniversary of the date of this agreement.]

   Control:  [has the meaning given in section 1124 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 OR the beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of a company or the legal power to direct or cause the direction of the general management of the company], and Controls, Controlled and the expression change of Control shall be interpreted accordingly.

   Control
 
Control is relevant to the definition of Affiliate and also under  which enables the supplier to terminate if there has been a change of control on the part of the customer.

   Critical Fault:  a reproducible fault which substantially hinders or prevents the Customer from using a material part of the functionality of the software in question.

   Critical Fault
 
This is an important definition (for both parties) as often the supplier’s obligations are defined by reference to the type of problem which the customer is experiencing with the software. It can help to ensure that the supplier has an obligation to provide support at a level that is appropriate to the problem which the customer is experiencing. However, defining the faults which the supplier of maintenance has an obligation to fix can be difficult. Sometimes they are defined by reference to specific documentation such as the specification for the software which sets out details of the software’s functionality. This can result in a more objective definition.
 
This standard document only distinguishes between two levels of faults (see the definition of Non-Critical Fault) but many maintenance agreements adopt a more detailed categorisation. For example, faults in Categories 1 and 2 might require immediate attention, faults in Category 3 might require individual attention but at a more leisurely pace, while faults in Category 4 would be fixed, if at all, only in a maintenance release. The supplier should ensure that any such terms reflect its practice in the provision of maintenance.

   Deliverables:  any documentation, software, know-how or other works created or supplied by the Supplier (whether alone or jointly) in the course of providing the Service, but shall not include the Supported Software.

   Deliverables
 
The definition of Deliverables makes it clear the Supported Software itself is not included. This is because the supplier provides indemnity protection with regard to any third party IPR claims received in respect of the Deliverables (see ) but any such claim brought in respect of the Supported Software should ideally be brought under the Licence instead.

   Documentation:  the documents provided by the Supplier for the Software, in either printed text or machine-readable form, including the technical documentation, program specification and operations manual.

   Enhanced Support Service:  the Support Service more particularly described in , which is to be provided by the Supplier to the Customer under  and .

   Extended Term:  has the meaning given to it in .

   Initial Term:  has the meaning given to it in .

   Intellectual Property Rights:  patents, utility models, rights to inventions, copyright and related rights, trade marks and service marks, trade names and domain names, rights in get-up, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off or unfair competition, rights in designs, rights in computer software, database rights, rights to preserve the confidentiality of information (including know-how and trade secrets) and any other intellectual property rights, including all applications for (and rights to apply for and be granted), renewals or extensions of, and rights to claim priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or will subsist, now or in the future, in any part of the world.

   Legacy Fees:  the charges for the Legacy Obligations set out in  of Schedule 5.

   Legacy Obligations:  the obligations in respect of non-current versions of the Software which are set out in  of Schedule 5.

   Licence:  the licence of [DATE] made between the Supplier and the Customer.

   Maintenance Release:  a release of the Software which corrects faults, adds functionality or otherwise amends or upgrades the Software, but which does not constitute a New Version.

   Maintenance Release
 
Where the services are being provided by a third-party maintainer rather than the software owner, references to Maintenance Releases and New Versions should be amended so that they refer to releases and versions issued by the software owner rather than the third-party maintainer (see Drafting note, Legal issues).

   Manager:  the person appointed by the Customer from time to time in order to fulfil the role described in .

   [Mandatory Policies:  the [Customer’s OR Supplier’s] business policies [and codes] [attached OR listed] in Schedule 8, as amended by notification to the [Supplier OR Customer] from time to time.]

   Mandatory Policies
 
This definition relates to the optional compliance requirement at  which offers two drafting options. The first is a requirement on the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies, and the second is a requirement on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. Ensure that this definition is consistent with the approach taken in clause 15.3.
 
See further the integrated drafting notes at  and also  above.

   Modification:  any Maintenance Release or New Version which is acquired by the Customer.

   New Version:  any new version of the Software which from time to time is publicly marketed and offered for purchase by the Supplier in the course of its normal business, being a version which contains such significant differences from the previous versions as to be generally accepted in the marketplace as constituting a new product.

   New Version
 
It is not always easy to distinguish between a new version and a maintenance release. The two definitions should be considered in the light of the supplier’s usual practice. , which accompanies this standard document (and which provides more information on definitions of New Version), does not include new versions within the licence of the software on the basis that the supplier reserves the right to require a separate licence for a new version (see the definition of Modification in that licence). However, the supplier might well be prepared to support new versions under the maintenance agreement and, consequently, the definition of Modification in this standard document includes new versions. If new versions are not to be supported, the definition needs to be amended accordingly.

   Non-Critical Fault:  any reproducible fault in the Software other than a Critical Fault.

   Non-Critical Fault
 
This is an important definition (for both parties) as often the supplier’s obligations are defined by reference to the type of problem which the customer is experiencing with the software. This standard document only distinguishes between two levels of faults. For more information, see .

   Open-Source Software:  open-source software as defined by the Open Source Initiative () or the Free Software Foundation () which forms part of the Deliverables.

   Optional Service:  any of the Services listed in  of Schedule 4 and any other services that the Customer and the Supplier may from time to time agree shall be supplied to the Customer by the Supplier under the terms of this agreement.

   Optional Service
 
Optional Services could include:
 
The maintenance of software not already covered under the agreement.
Support at sites not listed in the agreement.
Assistance given by the supplier to the customer in defining and costing any variation to the software.
Training additional members of the customer’s staff in the use of the software.

   Proprietary Third-Party Software:  any software forming part of the Deliverables that is not Open-Source Software and is not owned by the Supplier.

   Representatives:  has the meaning given in .

   [Service Levels:  those standards of performance to be achieved by the Supplier in performing the Standard Support Service and the Enhanced Support Service as set out in  of Schedule 2 and  of Schedule 3 respectively.]

   Services:  includes (as appropriate) the Standard Support Service, the Updating Service, the Enhanced Support Service and any Optional Services which are included within an order for Optional Services under .

   Software:  has the same meaning as in the Licence.

   Standard Support Service:  the support service more particularly described in  of Schedule 2, which is to be provided by the Supplier to the Customer under  and .

   Standard Support Hours:  8.00 am to 6.00 pm Monday to Friday, except on days which are bank holidays in England.

   Standard Support Hours
 
This is a critical definition (for both parties) and the supplier should ensure that it has the resources to meet the customer’s demands in this respect, and that the extent of its obligations is reflected in the charges.
 
Where support is to be provided during working hours, the supplier should try to ensure that these are the hours of its own normal working day.

   Support Manager:  the person appointed by the Supplier from time to time in order to fulfil the role described in .

   Support Staff:  those individuals who perform the Supplier’s obligations under this agreement including (where the context permits) the Support Manager.

   Supported Software:  has the meaning set out in .

   Third-Party Licences:  any licences under which Third-Party Software is provided.

   Third-Party Software:  means Open-Source Software or Proprietary Third-Party Software.

   Updating Service:  the service to be supplied by the Supplier to the Customer under  and .

   VAT:  value added tax imposed by the Value Added Tax Act 1994 [or any similar tax] chargeable in the UK [or elsewhere].

   VAT
 
Unless the parties are confident there will be no UK VAT or equivalent sales tax, we recommend that the wording “or elsewhere” should be retained in the document.

   1.2  The headings in this agreement do not affect its interpretation. Except where the context otherwise requires, references to clauses and schedules are to clauses and schedules of this agreement.

   1.3  Unless the context otherwise requires:

   (a)  The Schedules form part of this agreement and shall have effect as if set out in full in the body of this agreement. Any reference to this agreement includes the Schedules.

   (b)  Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular shall include the plural and in the plural shall include the singular.

   (c)  Unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to one gender shall include a reference to the other genders.

   (d)  A reference to any party shall include that party’s personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

   (e)  A reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as it is in force as at the date of this agreement.

   (f)  A reference to a statute or statutory provision shall include all subordinate legislation made as at the date of this agreement under that statute or statutory provision.

   (g)  Any words following the terms including, include, in particular, for example or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those terms.

   1.4  If there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions in the main body of this agreement and the Schedules, the provisions in the main body of this agreement shall prevail. [If any conflict arises between this agreement and the Licence, the terms of the Licence shall prevail.]

   Conflict
 
A provision of the kind contained in the first sentence of  is necessary where the contract is composed of multiple documents, as it is important to specify the precedence between those documents in the event of a conflict.
 
The second sentence of  (shown in square brackets) is for use when the maintenance agreement is linked with the licence agreement under which rights to use the software are granted to the customer, and care is accordingly needed in determining the precedence of the two agreements.

   1.5  A reference to a holding company or a subsidiary means a holding company or a subsidiary (as the case may be) as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006 [and a company shall be treated, for the purposes only of the membership requirement contained in sections 1159(1)(b) and (c), as a member of another company even if its shares in that other company are registered in the name of:

   (a)  another person (or its nominee) by way of security or in connection with the taking of security; or

   (b)  its nominee].

   [For the purposes of determining whether a limited liability partnership is a subsidiary of a company or another limited liability partnership, section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006 shall be interpreted so that: (a) references in sections 1159(1)(a) and (c) to voting rights are to the members’ rights to vote on all or substantially all matters which are decided by a vote of the members of the limited liability partnership; and (b) the reference in section 1159(1)(b) to the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors is to the right to appoint or remove members holding a majority of the voting rights.]

   1.6  If the Software is provided to a Customer in any country listed in , then that schedule shall also apply. Notwithstanding , in the case of conflict or ambiguity between any provision contained in the body of this agreement and any provision contained in that schedule, the provision contained in the schedule shall prevail, but only in respect of the Customer’s use of the Software in that country.

   Country-specific amendments
 
Increasingly, maintenance and support agreements are international in scope. Accordingly, provision has been made for country-specific amendments to be set out in . These amendments are likely to include practical details such as the names of the customer’s and supplier’s country representatives, as well as addressing local variations in the law, such as decompilation rights and the form and extent of the limitation of liability provisions.

   1.7  A person includes a natural person, corporate or unincorporated body (whether or not having separate legal personality) [and that person’s personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns].

   2.  SUPPORTED SOFTWARE

   2.1  The Supported Software is:

   (a)  the Software;

   (b)  any Modification which is acquired by the Customer (whether under the Licence, this agreement or any other agreement between the Supplier and the Customer) during the course of the Licence and which accordingly becomes part of the software defined as the Software under the Licence; and

   (c)  any other software which the Supplier and Customer agree should be Supported Software for the purposes of this agreement [including the software listed in ].

   Associated software
 
 is added because it may be convenient for associated software (which either was not supplied by the supplier or was supplied under a different licence) to be included within the same maintenance agreement.

   2.2  In relation to Maintenance Releases:

   (a)  as part of the Updating Service, the Supplier shall from time to time make Maintenance Releases available to the Customer without charge; and

   (b)  if the Customer fails to [acquire and install OR make arrangements for the installation of] a Maintenance Release within [one month] of the Supplier’s notifying the Customer that such Maintenance Release is available for installation, the Supplier may terminate this agreement by giving [one month’s] written notice to the Customer.

   Maintenance releases
 
Maintenance releases are intended to fix identified problems with the software and the customer will expect their supply to be part of the standard maintenance service provided by the supplier. While the customer may have reasons to postpone installation of maintenance releases, the supplier will not wish to be exposed to an obligation to continue to support software which has problems for which a fix exists.  sets out a compromise by protecting the supplier against continued postponement. However, the length of the notice periods in this clause are a matter for negotiation and depend, to some extent, on the nature of the software and the nature of the fault. For example, the supplier may wish to distinguish between types of maintenance release, with installation of emergency fixes (such as fixes which patch published security flaws) being mandatory within a very short period of release.
 
Note that termination under this provision is not a trigger event under the Escrow Agreement (see ).
 
 
Variation for SaaS solutions
 
Unlike on-premises software, most public cloud systems operate as a “permanent beta”, meaning that there are no manually provided versions of the software in the traditional sense. As new functionality is added or bugs are fixed in SaaS, these are incorporated into the online application. This means that the application being accessed through a web browser should always be the most up to date and  should not be required. See .
 
However, if the implementation of a maintenance release into the online application would impact the performance of the application, or the way that the customer accesses it (or the minimum system requirements necessary to access and run the application) then the customer may still want to receive advance notice of, and control (to some extent) the release of maintenance updates.

   2.3  [In relation to New Versions, if the Supplier releases a New Version and the Customer decides not to acquire and install such New Version, that decision shall not give rise to any right to terminate this agreement, nor shall it result in any adverse effect on the Services or the performance of the Supplier’s obligations under this agreement. However, if the Supplier has released a New Version since the version which forms part of the Supported Software, and the Customer has not, within [12] months of the Supplier’s having notified the Customer that a New Version is available, acquired and installed that New Version, the Supplier may terminate this agreement by giving [one month’s] written notice to the Customer given at any time after the expiry of such period. Pending any such termination the Supplier’s obligations in respect of the Supported Software shall be reduced to the Legacy Obligations and the Charges shall be reduced to the Legacy Fees.

   OR

   In relation to New Versions:

   (a)  If the Supplier releases a New Version, the Customer shall, within seven days of delivery, test whether the New Version operates without any impairment of functionality or facilities relative to the previous version (Acceptance Testing). If the Acceptance Testing is successful, the Customer shall promptly notify the Supplier in writing of its acceptance of the New Version. If the Acceptance Testing fails, the Customer may reject the New Version by written notice to the Supplier.

   (b)  If the New Version is rejected, that decision shall not give rise to any right to terminate this agreement, nor shall it result in any adverse effect on the Services or the performance of the Supplier’s obligations under this agreement. However, if the Supplier has released a New Version since the version which forms part of the Supported Software, and the Customer has not, within [12 months] of the Supplier having notified the Customer that a New Version is available, acquired and installed that New Version, the Supplier may terminate this agreement by giving [one month’s] written notice to the Customer, given at any time after the expiry of such period. Pending any such termination:

   (i)  the Supplier’s obligations in respect of the Supported Software shall be reduced to the Legacy Obligations;

   (ii)  the Charges shall be reduced to the Legacy Fees.

   (c)  The Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the New Version if the Supplier does not receive any notice under  within seven days of delivery of the New Version or the Customer commences operational use of the New Version.]

   New versions
 
There are a number of reasons why the customer may wish not to acquire a new version:
 
A new version may be very different from the existing version. In addition to the expense of acquisition, the installation of a new version may involve the customer in considerable expense as regards new hardware (for example, memory or data storage), training, conversion of data formats and so on.
The existing version of the software may have been customised to a large extent to meet the customer’s needs.
The customer may be committed to using the existing version of the software to provide particular services to its customers.
A new version may also contain new faults which would affect the operation of the software.
A new version may need higher system performance requirements to run and require the customer to upgrade or invest money in its computer system.
The customer will, therefore, want to resist any obligation to purchase a new version as a condition of obtaining continued support under the maintenance agreement. However, the supplier will want to avoid supporting multiple versions of its software. It is therefore not unusual for a supplier to agree to support the current version of its software and the immediately preceding versions (or the two immediately preceding), but to seek to be released from any obligation as regards earlier versions. An alternative approach, which has been adopted by at least one supplier recently, is to offer to support all versions of its software, but with the fee being directly related to the age of the software: the older it is, the greater the fee. The supplier should ensure that the terms of this clause reflect its practice in this respect.
 
Both alternative clauses allow the supplier to reduce its ongoing maintenance obligations (and the fee) in respect of out-of-date versions to a residual level for part of the period in which it has an obligation to support them. However, the second alternative can be used to put pressure on the customer to decide whether to accept or reject the new version much earlier on, that is, within seven days of delivery, and if it delays beyond that period it will be deemed to have accepted the new version under . Even if the customer does decide to reject it, the supplier will at least have ample warning which may assist with management of its business and resources.
 
 
SaaS solutions
 
Similar to how maintenance releases are dealt with, new versions and functionality can be automatically incorporated into the online application that is accessed via the customer’s web browser, meaning there should be no need for manual installations of new versions. However, a customer is still likely to be concerned about the release of new versions for the reasons stated above and may want to control and monitor this via their contract.

   3.  THE SERVICES

   3.1  The Supplier shall supply, and the Customer shall take and pay for, the following Services:

   (a)  the Standard Support Service;

   (b)  the Updating Service;

   (c)  the Enhanced Support Service; and

   (d)  such of the Optional Services as are included from time to time within an order for Optional Services agreed between the Supplier and the Customer under .

   Services to be supplied
 
The services specified in  are merely examples of the types of services which are supplied under a maintenance agreement. The standard support service and updating service are both likely to be obligatory, as the updating service (so far as it relates to maintenance releases) is merely another way of fixing faults. The enhanced support service may be optional (as, of course, are the optional services).

   3.2  [In relation to the Standard Support Service:

   (a)  the Standard Support Service shall be provided during the Standard Support Hours and shall comprise:

   (i)  [a telephone help desk to provide first-line technical support to users of the Supported Software;]

   Scope of help desk
 
The supplier should consider whether or not the help desk will provide technical assistance only. If so, the supplier will be obliged to receive only technical enquiries from the customer’s technical support team (likely to be a small number of easily-identified individuals). If not, it will also have to deal with queries from a much larger number of technically illiterate users. Use of the phrase “first-line support” suggests the latter. If helpdesk support is to be provided for technical queries only, the individuals who are entitled to seek this support should be identified in the agreement (and contact details specified).
 
The supplier may wish to limit the number of hours of helpdesk support it is obliged to provide (say, in each month of the term), in which case those hours should be specified. This might be because the customer is only willing to pay for a certain amount of helpdesk support or because the supplier has other customers and cannot afford to have all of its helpdesk resources used up by one customer. When 24/7 support is specified, the supplier should take care to allow for downtime for maintenance.
 
The supplier might also want to fix the maintenance fee by reference to the number or type of calls it is likely to receive to the helpdesk (see ).

   (ii)  [remote diagnosis and, where possible, correction of faults using the software management software[; and]]

   Remote diagnostics
 
The supplier should consider whether it can provide remote diagnostics. If so, an obligation should be imposed on the customer to permit remote access by the supplier and the customer should be required to accept and install any necessary equipment to facilitate such remote access (see ). Responsibility for this equipment and for communication links required between the locations involved should be specified.
 
Even where the supplier is not willing to agree to service levels, the customer will usually require some obligation as to the timing in which faults in the software will be corrected (which may vary according to the type of fault). If so, this clause could provide, for example, that the supplier will use “reasonable endeavours” to correct faults reported by the customer and to do so “as soon as reasonably practicable” (or within the stated time periods). The supplier should try to avoid an absolute or “best endeavours” obligation to correct faults since there may be faults which it is unable to remedy or which do not justify the time and expense involved. See

   (iii)  [up to [NUMBER] hours in any month of second-line on-site technical support,]

   all as more particularly defined in  of Schedule 2.

   Standard support service
 
More detailed descriptions of the elements making up the standard support service should be provided in Schedule 2. This should cover, for example:
 
The manner in which helpdesk queries or faults are to be reported to the supplier.
The information which must be provided by the customer to enable the supplier to deal with the query or fault.
The languages in which calls will be answered.
The customer is likely to want to address other issues, such as:
 
The manner and times in which the supplier is required to respond to queries or reports of faults.
The manner and the times in which the supplier must endeavour to correct faults.
The supplier should ensure that these obligations are reasonable, taking into consideration the resources available to it, and that they are reflected in the charges.

   (b)  if additional on-site support is required in any month it may be provided by the Supplier at its option at the rates set out in  of Schedule 2 (as varied from time to time in accordance with this agreement).

   On-site hours
 
The customer will wish to ensure that it is not left stranded if the agreed number of on-site hours is exceeded. However, if the supplier offers support to other users of the software, it may not easily be able to provide increased support to the customer on demand.

   (c)  where a Non-Critical Fault is to be corrected in a forthcoming Maintenance Release, then for a reasonable period before the issue of such Maintenance Release the Supplier may decline to provide assistance in respect of that Non-Critical Fault.

   Non-critical repairs
 
Where software is supplied to several organisations, it is usual for non-critical repairs to be collected together and fixed all at once in the next maintenance release.

   (d)  the Standard Support Service shall meet the Service Levels set out in  of Schedule 2.]

   Service levels
 
Where possible, the supplier should resist the imposition of service levels the breach of which entitles the customer to compensation. However, if the supplier agrees to such terms, some service measures appropriate to this type of agreement would be:
 
Time to respond to reports of faults.
Percentage of faults fixed on telephone or remotely.
Time between first telephone call and attendance on site.
Mean time to repair.
In general, suppliers will be more willing to contract for measures they can control (such as time to respond) than measures which may rely on others (such as mean time to repair, which might be dependent on parts, service or information from the manufacturer or distributor). As discussed, it is common for there to be a distinction between the times required to respond to or fix critical and non-critical faults, and sometimes support contracts justify the specification of a number of levels of faults each requiring its own response and fix times. If so, the service levels should be drafted to reflect the different obligations of the supplier in respect of each type of fault. Where the supplier is willing to accept them, it is important for it to ensure that the service levels are defined clearly.
 
For an example of a service level agreement, see .

   3.3  [In relation to the Updating Service:

   (a)  the Supplier shall issue Modifications of the Software as and when required [and in whatever form (including[, in the case of Non-Critical Faults,] by way of a local fix or patch of the Software or a temporary by-pass solution)] in the absolute discretion of the Supplier;

   Updating service
 
There is no obligation on the supplier to issue modifications to the software. It is clearly in the supplier’s interest to improve the software on an ongoing basis but it should not be obliged to do so at any particular time. If it is willing to accept any obligation to produce certain modifications at a particular time (such as to deal with changes in legislation to which the customer is subject), the supplier should ensure that it can do so within the time specified and that the obligation is reflected in the charges.
 
The customer may request terms requiring the supplier to test modifications and/or to install them. In the case of acceptance tests, the supplier needs to address what options it has if the modification does not pass the tests. In particular, it should ensure that it has the right to offer a refund if it is unable to fix any non-conformance.

   (b)  the Updating Service shall include the supply to the Customer of all revisions to the Documentation which are necessary in order to reflect any Modification acquired by the Customer;

   (c)  for the avoidance of doubt, the cost of the Updating Service is included in the Charges payable for the Standard Support Service, but excludes any sum payable by the Customer in respect of the licence of a New Version; and

   (d)  once any Modification has been installed by the Customer, the Customer shall return all copies of the Software or any part of the Software which is superseded by that Modification.]

   3.4  [In relation to the Enhanced Support Service:

   (a)  the Enhanced Support Service offers:

   (i)  support at times other than the Standard Service Hours; and

   (ii)  enhanced service levels when compared with the Standard Support Service,

   all as more particularly defined in  and  of Schedule 3;

   (b)  the Enhanced Support Service shall meet the Service Levels set out in  of Schedule 3.]

   Enhanced support service (optional clause)
 
 
Clause 3.4(a)
 
These provisions are suggestions. Other options include:
 
A dedicated (as opposed to shared) helpline.
Enhanced remote diagnostics and repair.
User training.
A dedicated on-site maintenance service.
 
Clause 3.4(a)(i)
The supplier needs to consider whether it has the resources to provide out-of-hours support. If this is an issue, the obligation could be limited to critical faults.
 
Clause 3.4(b)
 
As suggested in  the defining characteristic of an enhanced support service is likely to be enhanced service levels, for example, faster response times and a longer period of on-site maintenance. This clause should be deleted where service levels are not accepted by the supplier (see ).

   3.5  The Supplier may, on prior notice to the Customer, make changes to the Services, provided such changes do not have a material adverse effect on the Customer’s business operations.

   3.6  The Supplier shall have no obligation to provide the Services where faults arise from:

   (a)  misuse, incorrect use of or damage to the Software from whatever cause (other than any act or omission by the Supplier), including failure or fluctuation of electrical power;

   (b)  failure to maintain the necessary environmental conditions for use of the Software;

   (c)  use of the Software in combination with any equipment or software not provided by the Supplier or not designated by the Supplier for use with any Modification forming part of the Supported Software, or any fault in any such equipment or software;

   (d)  relocation [or installation] of the Software by any person other than the Supplier or a person acting under the Supplier’s instructions;

   (e)  any breach of the Customer’s obligations under this agreement howsoever arising or having the Software maintained by a third party;

   (f)  any Modification not authorised by the Supplier [resulting in a departure from the Specification (as defined in the Licence)]; or

   (g)  operator error.

   Exceptions
 
It is not unreasonable for the supplier to exclude its obligation to provide the services in circumstances where the customer causes the fault in the software.

   4.  ORDERS FOR OPTIONAL SERVICES

   4.1  The Customer may from time to time request the Supplier to supply Optional Services of the type set out in  of Schedule 4 at the rates referred to in . The Supplier shall use its reasonable endeavours to comply with the Customer’s request, but the Customer acknowledges that the Supplier’s ability to supply the Optional Services shall depend on the availability of appropriate resources at the time in question.

   Obligation to provide optional services
 
The supplier should avoid accepting an absolute obligation to provide optional services as it may find that it does not have the expertise or capacity to do so at the relevant time.

   4.2  Where the Supplier agrees to provide Optional Services, such agreement shall be embodied in an order for Optional Services. Each order for Optional Services shall be made under, and shall incorporate, the terms of this agreement.

   Terms of provision of optional services
 
By including this provision, the parties avoid the need to enter into a new agreement each time the customer requests additional services. However, it does not prevent the parties from agreeing different terms relating to optional services if they wish to do so.

   5.  SUPPORT STAFF

   5.1  The Supplier shall appoint a Support Manager, who shall be responsible for the co-ordination of all matters relating to the Services. All communications, documentation and materials relating to this agreement shall be sent as appropriate by the Support Manager to the Manager. Each party shall notify the other in writing promptly if there is any proposed change to those appointments.

   5.2  In addition to its Support Manager, the Supplier shall provide sufficient Support Staff to fulfil its obligations under the terms of this agreement. The Support Staff shall be suitably trained and experienced in the support and maintenance of the Supported Software.

   Team or individual
 
The supplier should consider whether the services require a team of support staff or whether they can be provided by a single individual.

   5.3  In the absence of the Support Manager or of any other member of the Support Staff for any reason, the Supplier shall supply a replacement person who:

   (a)  is appropriately trained and competent to fulfil the role required of them; and

   (b)  has undergone a suitable period of familiarisation with the Services to enable them to perform the functions of the person they are replacing.

   6.  FURTHER TERMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES

   6.1  The Supplier’s obligation to provide on-site services shall extend to [all the sites of the Customer situated within the UK OR the sites listed in ].

   Sites at which support is to be provided
 
If the customer has the right to use the software at a number of sites, it may be difficult for the supplier to refuse to support the software at all of those sites. Another approach would be to draft the agreement to allow the customer to add sites to the agreement on payment of an agreed additional fee.
 
In any event, the supplier needs to consider whether it has the resources to provide on-site support at a number of locations taking into consideration the travelling time to sites located far from the supplier’s operations (the customer may be a global business with rights to use the software in a number of countries).

   6.2  The Supplier shall ensure that, while on the Customer’s premises, the Support Manager, the Support Staff and all other persons who enter such premises with the authority of the Supplier for the purpose of, or in connection with, this agreement or the provision of the Services, adhere to the Customer’s security procedures and health and safety regulations, as from time to time notified to the Supplier or otherwise brought to the notice of the Supplier or such persons. The Customer may remove or refuse admission to any person who is, or has been, in material breach of such procedures and regulations. However, the Supplier shall incur no liability for any delay in performing or failure to perform its obligations under this agreement as a result of compliance with the terms of this .

   7.  CHARGES

   Charges
 
Where the customer is in the financial services sector, and particularly if it operates globally, it may be subject to regulatory requirements (for example, the US) precluding it from assuming any liabilities or debts of its non-regulated affiliates. In these circumstances, the customer may request a provision to the effect that, although it can act as a channel for its affiliates for invoicing and payment administration purposes, the affiliates themselves will bear sole responsibility for payment for services which they receive. If this principle is acceptable to the supplier, it should nevertheless ensure that it has a direct contractual link with each affiliate, for example, by requiring it to sign a deed of adherence with the supplier. This will enable the supplier to enforce any outstanding obligations directly against the relevant affiliate.
 
For more information on restrictions on transactions between US banks and their affiliates, see .

   7.1  In consideration of the Services (excluding for this purpose any Optional Services and New Versions), the Customer shall pay the Charges set out in  of Schedule 2 and  of Schedule 3. These Charges shall be paid [monthly OR quarterly OR annually] in advance by the Customer to the Supplier within [30] days of the date of the Supplier’s invoice.

   Charges for principal services
 
In some cases, charges for support are calculated by reference to the number of hours or days of support which are provided to the customer in any particular month, quarter or year of the term, rather than on a fixed-sum basis. If so, the agreement should be amended to reflect this and could provide for a sum to be paid in advance, with additional sums being paid, or refunded, at the end of the payment period to reflect the actual amount of support provided.

   7.2  Charges for any New Version or Optional Services to the Customer shall be [determined in accordance with  of Schedule 4 and] agreed in writing before performance or supply by the Supplier, and shall be charged and invoiced to the Customer by the Supplier (and paid by the Customer) following acceptance by the Supplier of the Customer’s written order for such New Version or such Optional Service (as the case may be).

   Charges for any New Version or Optional Services
 
The customer will usually want the charges for extra services to be specified in the agreement on the basis that, once the agreement is signed, the supplier may have no incentive to agree reasonable rates. The supplier might argue, however, that it cannot specify the charges for services until it knows the nature of the services to be provided.

   7.3  The Customer shall pay all costs (at the Supplier’s then prevailing rates) and [reasonable] expenses incurred by the Supplier for work carried out by the Supplier in connection with any fault which is not covered by this agreement.

   Costs of investigating out-of-scope costs
 
The investigation of faults not covered by the agreement would not come within the scope of optional services as the customer might not realise at the time of its request for support that the problem is not one which the supplier has an obligation to fix. For that reason, a separate payment obligation is included. However, the customer is likely to resist this on the basis that it might have been perfectly reasonable at the time to report the software as faulty. However, if the rates for optional services are set at an advantageous figure, then the supplier might consider replacing  with the following provision:
 
”Any support provided by the Supplier, in its discretion, in any of the circumstances described in clause 3.6, including any time spent and expenses incurred by the Supplier in investigating or attempting to resolve any error, fault, defect or problem which is ultimately identified as arising from any such circumstances, or in any circumstances where the Supplier reasonably determines that the Software is substantially fulfilling the Specification, shall be deemed to be an agreed Optional Service and charged to the Customer in accordance with clause 4 and clause 7.2.”

   7.4  The Customer shall reimburse any [reasonable] [travel or subsistence] expenses incurred by the Supplier where such expenses are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of providing on-site support as part of the Services, provided that any request for reimbursement is in the form of a proper invoice accompanied by appropriate receipts.

   Reimbursement of expenses
 
Whether expenses are included within the charges or are recoverable by the supplier separately will vary from contract to contract. The customer is likely to resist this in favour of having a set figure to pay for maintenance each year, quarter or month. However, this will depend on how the charges for the services have been calculated. The wording in square brackets is included as a concession to the customer.
 
This provision is likely to be particularly relevant where the supplier is providing the services on-site.

   7.5  If the Customer fails to make any payment due to the Supplier under this agreement by the due date for payment, then[, without limiting the Supplier’s remedies under ,] the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [4]% per annum above [FULL NAME OF BANK]’s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.

   Interest
 
The level of the interest rate is a matter for negotiation. However, if, for example, the customer uses its bargaining leverage to set the rate too low to provide a substantial remedy for the supplier for late payment, the supplier may be able to seek redress under the . In accordance with the regulations made under that Act, the mandated interest rate may be very high indeed. To focus the customer’s mind during negotiations, the supplier would do well to mention this.
 
Consider also whether to include a right to suspend the performance of the services in the event of late payment.
 
For more information and an alternative clause, see the integrated drafting notes to  and .

   7.6  All payments made by the Customer under this agreement are exclusive of VAT. The Supplier shall provide the Customer with a valid VAT invoice. The Customer shall pay any stamp duties or similar transfer taxes imposed on the supplies made under this agreement and shall reimburse the Supplier for any such stamp duties or similar transfer taxes paid by the Supplier. If the Customer is required to make any deduction for or on account of tax from any payment due under this agreement (Tax Deduction):

   (a)  The Customer shall account to the relevant tax authority for such Tax Deduction and shall provide evidence to the Supplier that it has so accounted.

   (b)  The amount of the payment due under this Agreement shall be increased so that the Supplier receives an amount equal to the amount that would have been received by it, had the Customer not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   7.7  The Customer and the Supplier shall co-operate to minimise the amount of any Tax Deduction. If following the making of a Tax Deduction, the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion/ acting in good faith] that it (or any member of the Supplier’s group) has received and retained any credit, relief or other benefit as a result of the Tax Deduction, the Supplier shall pay such amount to the Customer as the Supplier determines [in its sole discretion OR acting in good faith] would leave the Supplier in the same position as if the Customer had not been required to make any Tax Deduction.

   Tax
 
Unless each party wishes to bear the tax risks “as they fall”, there must be appropriate provisions relating to tax payments (such as value added taxes) and tax withholding requirements. It may be necessary to have wording to deal with tax withholding, particularly in respect of licence fees, where that is relevant. It is always advisable to obtain expert tax advice on the structuring of payments before any agreement is entered into.

   7.8  The Supplier may increase the Charges [following not less than three months’ written notice] on an annual basis with effect from each anniversary of the date of this agreement in line with the percentage increase in the [Consumer Prices Index (all items) OR [APPROPRIATE INDEX]] in the preceeding 12 month period, and the first such increase shall take effect from the [first OR second] anniversary of the date of this agreement and shall be based the latest available figure for the percentage increase in the [Consumer Prices Index (all items) OR [APPROPRIATE INDEX]].

   Review of charges
 
It is not unreasonable for the supplier to seek the right to review the charges for the services at appropriate intervals during the term of a software maintenance agreement. However, the customer is likely to resist a provision which allows the supplier to increase the charges without some limit on the level of increase. As a compromise, the supplier might agree to cap the increase to a specified percentage (for example, 10%) or to set the increase by reference to an index.
 
There are many different indices to which the price could be linked, so the parties will need to specify one. Linking the price to an inappropriate index may not achieve the desired result and may be counterproductive. For further information on the differences between the principal UK indices and to help identify which index may be appropriate to different types of contract, see . For an alternative clause, see  of .
 
The customer should also consider this clause in the light of its rights to terminate so as to ensure that it has the option of terminating the agreement if any increase in the charges is unacceptable. Bear in mind that the publication dates for these statistics are unlikely to correspond exactly with the contract years, and so any percentage increases linked to one of these indices will be approximate only.

   7.9  All amounts due under this agreement shall be paid by the Customer to the Supplier in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law).

   Payment not to be withheld
 
The customer is obliged to make timely payment, even if dissatisfied with the services. This clause does not exclude other avenues for redress.
 
For information on set-off clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to  and .

   8.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

   Intellectual Property Rights
 
This clause relates to works created in the course of providing the services and not to the supported software, itself, which should ideally be subject to its own provisions with respect of intellectual property rights (IPRs) under the Licence, see .

   8.1  All Intellectual Property Rights in the Deliverables shall belong to the Supplier, and the Customer shall have no rights in respect of any of the Deliverables except as expressly granted under this agreement. The Customer shall do or procure to be done all such further acts and things and sign or procure the signature of all such other documents as the Supplier may from time to time require for the purpose of giving the Supplier the full benefit of the provisions of this .

   Further assurance
 
For more information and an alternative clause, see  and its accompanying drafting note.

   8.2  The Supplier undertakes at its own expense to defend the Customer or, at its option, settle any claim or action brought against the Customer alleging that the use or possession of any of the Deliverables (or any part of them) by the Customer in accordance with this agreement infringes the UK Intellectual Property Rights of a third party (Claim) and shall be responsible for any reasonable losses, damages, costs (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by, or awarded against, the Customer as a result of or in connection with any such Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, Clause 8.2 shall not apply where the Claim in question is attributable to possession, use, development, modification or maintenance of the Deliverables (or any part thereof) by the Customer other than in accordance with the terms of this agreement, use of the Deliverables in combination with any hardware or software not supplied or specified by the Supplier, if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Deliverables not so combined, or use of a non-current release of the Software.

   Scope of undertaking to defend
 
In addition to the warranty in  the customer is likely to seek further contractual protection, usually in the form of an indemnity, against losses arising from claims that its use of any of the deliverables infringes third-party IPRs (see ). The extent of that protection is, however, a matter for negotiation. The supplier might agree, for example, to compensate, rather than indemnify, the customer in respect of IPR infringements.
 
The supplier might also try to limit the obligation to breaches of UK IPRs, since the supplier does not want to be liable should it turn out that any of the deliverables infringe IPRs which exist in an overseas jurisdiction. However, where the services are provided in more than one country, the customer may want the protection to extend at least to those countries. If the supplier has already supplied similar services in those countries and no valid third-party claim has been made to date, this may afford some comfort to the supplier should it decide to accept this request, but of course this does not rule out any valid claims being made in the future.
 
In particular, the supplier may wish to seek to exclude US patents and patent applications from the scope of this clause, because of the proliferation of software and business method patents in that country.
 
It is possible that, as a matter of contract, the cap on liability contained in  of the standard document would apply to this clause (even without  which expressly states that the cap applies).
 
There is provision for various exceptions to the supplier’s obligation, effectively where the customer’s actions have to some extent contributed to the infringement claim being brought.
 
Further issues to consider include which party is to control any litigation or settlement negotiations. Suppliers should seek to have the conduct (which would be in line with ) but customers may resist this. They may wish to avoid protracted litigation, diverting management from more productive activities, and possibly harming reputation.

   8.3  Clause 8.2 is conditional on the Customer:

   (a)  as soon as reasonably practicable, giving written notice of the Claim to the Supplier, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;

   (b)  not making any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Supplier (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed);

   (c)  giving the Supplier and its professional advisers at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to its premises and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Customer, so as to enable the Supplier and its professional advisers to examine them and to take copies (at the Supplier’s expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim; and

   (d)  subject to the Supplier providing security to the Customer to the Customer’s reasonable satisfaction against any claim, liability, costs, expenses, damages or losses which may be incurred, taking such action as the Supplier may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, compromise or defend the Claim.

   8.4  If any Claim is made, or in the Supplier’s reasonable opinion is likely to be made, against the Customer, the Supplier may at its sole option and expense:

   (a)  procure for the Customer the right to continue using, developing, modifying or maintaining the Deliverables (or any part of them) in accordance with the terms of this agreement;

   (b)  modify the Deliverables so that they cease to be infringing [providing they provide comparable functionality];

   (c)  replace the Deliverables with non-infringing works [providing comparable functionality]; or

   (d)  terminate this agreement immediately on notice to the Customer and repay to the Customer all sums which the Customer has paid to the Supplier under this agreement during the year in which the termination occurs, less a charge for the Services performed up to the date of termination.

   8.5  Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement, Clause 8.2 shall not apply to the extent that any claim or action referred to in that clause arises directly or indirectly through the possession, use, development, modification or maintenance of any Open-Source Software or Proprietary Third-Party Software incorporated into the Deliverables.

   8.6  This  constitutes the Customer’s exclusive remedy and the Supplier’s only liability in respect of Claims and, for the avoidance of doubt, is subject to .

   Exclusive remedy
 
The customer’s remedies regarding infringement claims are limited to this clause, and the supplier’s liability under this clause is capped under .

   9.  THE CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITIES

   9.1  Without prejudice to , the Customer shall provide the Supplier, the Support Manager, the Support Staff and all other persons duly authorised by the Supplier with full, safe and uninterrupted access [including remote access] to the Customer’s premises [and the sites listed in ], systems, facilities and the Software as may reasonably be required for the purpose of performing the Services, such access, except in the case of emergency or agreed out-of-hours downtime, to be within the Standard Support Hours. Where the Services are to be performed at any of the Customer’s premises [and sites listed in ], the Customer shall provide adequate working space and office facilities (including telephone) for use by the Support Staff and take reasonable care to ensure their health and safety.[Where remote access is required by the Supplier, the Customer shall facilitate such remote access by promptly installing and running any remote access tools reasonably required and provided by the Supplier].

   9.2  The Customer shall ensure that appropriate environmental conditions are maintained for the Supported Software and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Supported Software is operated in a proper manner by the Customer’s employees.

   9.3  The Customer shall nominate a manager to be available to liaise with, and respond to queries from, the Support Manager.

   Customer’s manager
 
It is important for the supplier to minimise the number of people it has to deal with at the customer. If it is not reasonable for the manager to be the sole liaison with the support manager and the support staff, then other named individuals should be specified (and contact details included in the agreement).

   9.4  The Customer shall:

   (a)  co-operate with the Supplier in performing the Services and provide any assistance or information as may reasonably be required by the Supplier, including in relation to the diagnosis of any faults;

   (b)  report faults promptly to the Supplier; and

   (c)  keep full backup copies of all of its data.

   9.5  The Customer shall indemnify the Supplier against any losses, damages, costs (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by or awarded against the Supplier as a result of the Customer’s breach of this agreement howsoever arising or any negligent or wrongful act of the Customer, its officers, employees, contractors or agents.

   Indemnity by Customer
 
The Customer will resist this clause. As a compromise it could be limited to losses suffered by reason of death, injury or damage to property caused by the customer. If the terms of  are included for the benefit of the customer as well, the limit set out in  may apply to reduce the customer’s liability under this clause.

   10.  MEETINGS

   For the duration of this agreement, the Manager, the Support Manager and such Support Staff as may from time to time be considered appropriate shall meet at least once in each calendar month at a Customer office location and at a time to be agreed between the Manager and the Support Manager, for the purpose of discussing provision of the Services[, the achievement of the Service Levels] and any other appropriate matters.

   11.  NON-SOLICITATION

   Non-solicitation
 
The customer should ensure that the non-poaching obligations are imposed on the supplier as well since the customer may equally be concerned about the supplier approaching staff within the customer’s organisation who are experienced in the use and support of the software.
 
While a prohibition on solicitation is enforceable during the period of the contract, it runs the risk of challenge as a restraint of trade if it extends beyond the expiry of the contract.
 
For alternative clauses and further commentary on these issues, see .

   Neither party shall, for the duration of this agreement[, and for a period of six months following termination,] directly or indirectly induce or attempt to induce any employee of the other party who has been engaged in the provision, receipt, review or management of the Services or otherwise in connection with this agreement to leave the employment of that other party.

   12.  RISK AND TITLE

   12.1  Risk in, and title to, any media bearing any Deliverables or other information that may from time to time be supplied by the Supplier to the Customer shall pass to the Customer on acceptance by the Customer.

   13.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY

   Confidentiality and publicity
 
Confidentiality obligations are important since, in a software maintenance arrangement, the customer may become familiar with the products, methodologies, know-how or other aspects of the supplier’s business.
 
The obligations have been imposed on both parties, however, in order to address the customer’s concerns that the supplier, in providing software maintenance services, may learn a great deal about the customer’s business (particularly as the supplier’s staff will often be located at the customer’s premises).
 
It is in the interests of both parties to provide early notification of breach of confidentiality, to mitigate loss, and to provide assistance in, for example, seeking an injunction.

   13.1  Confidential Information means all confidential information (however recorded or preserved) disclosed by a party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the other party and that party’s Representatives [whether before or] [after the date of this agreement] in connection with [DESCRIBE TRANSACTION OR CONTRACT], including but not limited to:

   (a)  [the [existence and] terms of this agreement [or any agreement entered into in connection with this agreement];]

   (b)  any information that would be regarded as confidential by a reasonable business person relating to:

   (i)  the business, assets, affairs, customers, clients, suppliers, [or] plans [, intentions, or market opportunities] of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)]; and

   (ii)  the operations, processes, product information, know-how, designs, trade secrets or software of the disclosing party [(or of any member of the group of companies to which the disclosing party belongs)];

   (c)  any information developed by the parties in the course of carrying out this agreement; and

   (d)  any information detailed in Schedule [NUMBER].

   Representatives means, in relation to a party, its employees, officers, contractors, subcontractors, representatives and advisers.

   13.2  The provisions of this clause shall not apply to any Confidential Information that:

   (a)  is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in breach of this clause);

   (b)  was available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before disclosure by the disclosing party;

   (c)  was, is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a person who, to the receiving party’s knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party or otherwise prohibited from disclosing the information to the receiving party; [or]

   (d)  the parties agree in writing is not confidential or may be disclosed[; or]

   (e)  [is developed by or for the receiving party independently of the information disclosed by the disclosing party.]

   13.3  Each party shall keep the other party’s Confidential Information secret and confidential and shall not:

   (a)  use such Confidential Information except for [the purpose of exercising or performing its rights and obligations under or in connection with this agreement OR [SPECIFY PURPOSE]] (Permitted Purpose); or

   (b)  disclose such Confidential Information in whole or in part to any third party, except as expressly permitted by this .

   13.4  A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to those of its Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, provided that:

   (a)  it informs such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information before disclosure; and

   (b)  at all times, it is responsible for such Representatives’ compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in this clause.

   13.5  A party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, by any governmental or other regulatory authority (including, without limitation, [ANY RELEVANT SECURITIES EXCHANGES]) or by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction provided that, to the extent it is legally permitted to do so, it gives the other party as much notice of such disclosure as possible [and, where notice of disclosure is not prohibited and is given in accordance with this , it takes into account the reasonable requests of the other party in relation to the content of such disclosure].

   13.6  [A party may, provided that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party is involved in activity that may constitute a criminal offence under the Bribery Act 2010, disclose Confidential Information to the Serious Fraud Office without first informing the other party of such disclosure.]

   13.7  Each party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights or obligations in respect of a party’s Confidential Information other than those expressly stated in this [clause OR agreement] are granted to the other party, or to be implied from this agreement.

   13.8  On termination [or expiry] of this agreement, each party shall:

   (a)  destroy or return to the other party all documents and materials (and any copies) containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the other party’s Confidential Information;

   (b)  erase all the other party’s Confidential Information from computer and communications systems and devices used by it, including such systems and data storage services provided by third parties (to the extent technically and legally practicable); and

   (c)  certify in writing to the other party that it has complied with the requirements of this clause, provided that a recipient party may retain documents and materials containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or any applicable governmental or regulatory authority. The provisions of this clause shall continue to apply to any such documents and materials retained by a recipient party, subject to clause [NUMBER] (Termination).

   13.9  [Except as expressly stated in this agreement, no party makes any express or implied warranty or representation concerning its Confidential Information.]

   13.10  [The provisions of this  shall [continue to apply after termination [or expiry] of this agreement OR survive for a period of [five] years from termination [or expiry] of this agreement].]

   13.11  [The Supplier may refer to the Customer as being a client of the Supplier in customer reference lists and sales presentations, but shall not refer to the Customer in any advertising or press release without the prior written consent of the Customer.]

   Publicity (optional)
 
The customer may be wary of the supplier using its name for publicity purposes. Accordingly, it is likely that clause  will need to be tailored to meet its particular concerns.

   14.  DATA PROTECTION

   Data protection
 
For more information on data protection, and the appropriate clauses to be inserted here, see .

   14.1  [INSERT APPROPRIATE DATA PROTECTION CLAUSES]

   15.  EXPORT [AND COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES]

   15.1  Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other party under this agreement (or any products, including software, incorporating any such data) in breach of any applicable laws or regulations (Export Control Laws), including United States export laws and regulations, to any country for which the United States or any other government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export licence or other governmental approval without first obtaining such licence or approval.

   Export control
 
Technology export control laws are becoming increasingly pervasive and stringent around the world. In the UK, for example, there is the  (and various orders made under it) and similar laws in the US include the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Under US law a restricted asset may be deemed to be exported in a variety of circumstances, such as where services are performed by a non-US national outside of the US and this involves remote access to restricted assets in the US. For example, a software engineer in South East Asia might access a computer in the US for the purpose of performing maintenance on a restricted piece of software.

   15.2  Each party undertakes:

   (a)  contractually to oblige any third party to whom it discloses or transfers any such data or products to make an undertaking to it in similar terms to the one set out above; and

   (b)  if requested, to provide the other party with any reasonable assistance, at the reasonable cost of the other party, to enable it to perform any activity required by any competent government or agency in any relevant jurisdiction for the purpose of compliance with any Export Control Laws.

   15.3  [In performing its obligations under this agreement the [Supplier OR Customer] shall comply with the Mandatory Policies.]

   Mandatory policies
 
This clause can be used where the customer or supplier has specific business policies and wants to ensure that the other party complies with them. The policies might reflect a party’s legal obligations, for instance, its obligations under instruments such as the Modern Slavery Act 2015 () the Bribery Act 2010 (see ) or the data protection legislation (). Alternatively, a party may have adopted business social responsibility policies voluntarily.
 
In most goods or services agreements, the obligation is usually on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. But this may not always be the case: depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, a supplier may well require the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies instead. As this is a pro-supplier agreement, the supplier may want to omit this clause altogether from the first draft provided to the customer.
 
If the supplier does choose to include this clause, there are two drafting options:
 
The first is a requirement on the customer to comply with the supplier’s policies. This is slightly unusual (the usual position is that a supplier agrees to comply with the customer’s policies), but a supplier who is concerned about its reputation may well want to ensure that it is only supplying goods or services to customers who are willing to comply with the supplier’s policies on issues such as anti-bribery, modern slavery and ethics.
The second option is a requirement on the supplier to comply with the customer’s policies. This is the more usual approach in a goods or services agreement. A supplier may include this option if, for instance, it has already agreed in principle that it is able to comply with the customer’s policies, or the parties already have an ongoing relationship where the supplier is comfortable with complying with the customer’s policies.
Whatever approach is taken, check that the definition of  is consistent with the approach in this clause.
 
Note also that if the customer agrees to comply with the supplier’s policies, the supplier may want a subsequent right to terminate the agreement if the customer breaches those policies. If this is desired, the supplier could include this additional right to terminate at . For an example of this, see .
 
For more information on general compliance clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   16.  THE SUPPLIER’S WARRANTIES

   The Supplier’s warranties
 
The legal and commercial issues relating to warranties and limitations of liability are discussed fully in .

   WARNING: You are strongly advised to read the drafting notes dealing with this clause and clause 17 before use.

   16.1  The Supplier represents and warrants to the Customer that:

   (a)  the Services will be performed:

   (i)  in accordance with all laws and regulations which are directly applicable to the Supplier; and

   (ii)  with all reasonable skill and care; [and]

   (b)  [to the best of its knowledge and belief, the Deliverables will not infringe the UK Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; and]

   (c)  at the date of this agreement, the Supplier has obtained and will maintain for the duration of this agreement all permissions, licences and consents necessary for the Supplier to perform the Services.

   Representations and warranties
 
 
Clause 16.1(a)(ii)
 
This is a basic warranty typically given by suppliers under software maintenance agreements. It reflects the provisions of  of the  (SGSA) which implies a term in a contract for the supply of services that the supplier will carry out the services with reasonable care and skill.
 
Clause 16.1(b) (optional)
 
The customer will want protection against third-party claims which might hinder its freedom to use any works produced pursuant to the services and the supplier should be prepared to meet the customer’s concerns in this respect. The supply may prefer to do this by way of the indemnity in , however, rather than providing a separate warranty, and if it does agree to provide a warranty it will want to insist this is awareness qualified.
 
Where the supplier is a third-party maintainer, it will want to make it clear that this warranty extends only to its own materials, carving out materials produced by the software owner such as the documentation.

   16.2  If, during the term of this agreement, the Supplier receives written notice from the Customer of any breach by the Supplier of the representations and warranties contained in , the Supplier shall, at its own option and expense, remedy that breach within a reasonable period following receipt of such notice, or terminate this agreement immediately on written notice to the Customer and repay to the Customer all sums which the Customer has paid to the Supplier under this agreement during the year in which the termination occurs, less a charge for the Services performed up to the date of termination. The Customer shall provide all information reasonably necessary to enable the Supplier to comply with its obligations under this . This clause sets out the Customer’s sole remedy and the Supplier’s entire liability for breach of .

   Right to terminate
 
The customer is likely to resist granting the supplier a right to terminate in the event of a breach of warranty. However, as discussed, there may be faults in the software which the supplier is unable to fix (or which do not justify the time and expense in fixing) and the supplier will not want to be under an obligation to fix such faults, especially if it has accepted an obligation to comply with service levels.
 
This is a sole remedy clause and is, therefore, subject to the provisions of .

   16.3  No representation or warranty is given by the Supplier that all faults will be fixed, or will be fixed within a specified period of time.

   16.4  All other conditions, warranties or other terms which might have effect between the parties or be implied or incorporated into this agreement or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded, including the implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and the use of reasonable skill and care.

   Exclusion of implied and other warranties
 
This clause seeks to exclude the operation of terms which are implied by law into agreements of this kind. The supplier must consider the rules relating to unfair contract terms in drafting this type of exclusion.
 
The exclusion of the implied term relating to services under  of SGSA (namely, that the services will be carried out with reasonable care and skill) will be subject to  of UCTA. This provides that liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence cannot be excluded by contract (this is addressed in  of the standard document), and any other damage caused by negligence can only be excluded provided it is reasonable. Here, an express term obliging the supplier to use reasonable skill and care is included in , but this is subject to the limits set out in .
 
 also covers terms which are implied in contracts for the transfer of goods under  and  of SGSA, as well as to implied terms relating to services. This is necessary where the supplier provides goods to the customer pursuant to the performance of the services, for example, a disk containing a software patch (see ). Since exclusion clauses are construed against the person relying on them, it is necessary to refer to the exclusion of conditions as well as warranties in this clause to ensure that all types of implied terms are excluded.
 
Under UCTA, the exclusion of the terms implied under sections 3 and 4 of SGSA must be reasonable. However, this may be difficult to establish in the absence of any express terms as to the quality or fitness of any products provided to the customer under the agreement.
 
This clause places the onus on the customer to ensure that the express terms of the agreement provide adequate protection. The customer may therefore resist this provision.
 
For further discussion on this topic, see .

   17.  LIMITS OF LIABILITY

   Limitation of liability
 
For further discussion on negotiating limits of liability in maintenance agreements, see .
 
For more general information, see the following practice notes relating to limiting liability in B2B contracts:
 
.
.
.
.
The provisions relating to liability have been drafted on the basis that the parties are both commercial entities.
 
In  the supplier seeks to limit its liability for damage to property, to exclude liability for some categories of financial loss, all consequential loss and losses arising from misrepresentation, and to cap any remaining liability to the charges payable under the agreement in the year in which any liability arises. All of these provisions are subject to  whereby the supplier expressly accepts liability for matters which, by law, cannot be excluded by contract (such as death or personal injury caused by negligence and fraud). The standard document seeks to find a balance by accepting some types of liability and excluding or limiting other liability, and the terms used are commonly found in agreements of this kind.
 
This does not mean that these terms would be upheld in every transaction should a dispute ever arise between the parties since their enforceability will depend on the particular circumstances. Those circumstances need to be taken into account by the supplier when finalising drafting since, if a particular exclusion or limitation of liability is held to be unreasonable under  (where this applies), it will be struck out leaving that supplier facing potentially unlimited liability for the particular type of loss. With this in mind, the various categories of loss have been included in separate sub-clauses (see ).
 
The customer may request that any exclusions and limitations are included for its benefit as well, although it is, of course, the supplier which is much more likely to need to rely on them.
 
The supplier should review all of  (particularly ) in the light of its own insurance arrangements, as the possible variations are many. Sometimes there are special arrangements concerning damage to the supplier’s own tangible property and injuries to its personnel. In some cases, the parties may be content to let the loss lie where it falls, irrespective of fault (known as knock-for-knock). In other cases, the policies may dictate a fault-based approach.

   17.1  Except as expressly stated in :

   (a)  the Supplier shall not in any circumstances have any liability for any losses or damages which may be suffered by the Customer (or any person claiming under or through the Customer), whether the same are suffered directly or indirectly or are immediate or consequential, and whether the same arise in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise howsoever, which fall within any of the following categories:

   Exclusions of liability
 
A supplier should consider including the categories of loss it would be prepared to accept. Alternatively, and this is the approach adopted in the standard document, the clause should state explicitly that the clause does not attempt to exclude all categories of financial loss, and some categories of direct financial loss may be recoverable (see proviso at end of ).
 
Clear words must be used if an exclusion or restriction of liability for negligence is to be effective, see .

   (i)  special damage, even though the Supplier was aware of the circumstances in which such special damage could arise;

   (ii)  loss of profits;

   (iii)  loss of anticipated savings;

   (iv)  loss of business opportunity;

   (v)  loss of or goodwill;

   (vi)  loss of, or damage to (including corruption of), data;

   Loss of data
 
In the course of providing software maintenance, there is always a danger that the customer’s data may be lost. An exclusion of liability for loss of data may not be upheld as reasonable in the context of a software support agreement. Consequently, an obligation on the customer to backup data on a regular basis has been included in the agreement (see ). In Logical Computer Supplies v Euro Car Parks Ltd [2001] All ER (D) 197 (Jun) it was held that, where a customer lost data during the course of work carried out by its software supplier, the damages were reduced by the customer’s contributory negligence in failing to have a system in place to backup data. Even so, it is advisable for the supplier to address the issue expressly in the agreement.
 
The customer may press for unlimited liability in respect of loss of data, for example, where data is being migrated (during the course of provision of optional services). The supplier should resist such a request, but ultimately a limit equal to the cost of reconstituting the lost data might be acceptable. The customer may insist that it is made clear that liability for breaches of any obligations to be included in  (data protection) are not excluded by the operation of , see .

   provided that this  shall not prevent claims for loss of or damage to the Customer’s tangible property that fall within the terms of  or any other claims for direct financial loss that are not excluded by any of categories (i) to (vi) inclusive of this ;

   (b)  the total liability of the Supplier, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise and whether in connection with this agreement or any collateral contract, shall in no circumstances exceed a sum equal to [[PERCENTAGE] percent ([PERCENTAGE]%) of] the Charges payable by the Customer in the [calendar year OR Contract Year] in which the liability arises.

   Liability cap
 
This clause seeks to limit any remaining liability of the supplier to a sum equal to a proportion of the price payable under the contract in the year (whether a calendar year or a contract year) in which the liability arises. A cap equal to 100% of the annual support fee is common in IT support contracts. However, there is no guarantee that such a limitation would be upheld by a court in all cases and the supplier needs to consider whether it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of each transaction. Suppliers sometimes prefer to increase the level to 125%, 150% or even 200% of the annual fee in order to increase the likelihood of reasonableness being established, but there are no fixed rules in this regard.
 
It is unlikely that a cap to fees paid in a year, rather than fees payable, would be enforceable if it meant, for example, that in a contract aligned to the calendar year which was terminated in January of the fourth year, the supplier’s liability would be capped at the equivalent of one month’s fees.
 
A cap may be set at the level of insurance cover where the supplier effects insurance for the specific contract. For an example of a limitation of liability clause that was held unenforceable in light of the insurance arrangements, see Ampleforth Abbey Trust v Turner & Townsend Project Management Ltd [2012] EWHC 2137 (TCC) (reported in )
 
Where the standard document is being used to create a framework agreement together with country-specific amendments (see ), the customer may seek to ensure that the individual liability caps which apply in respect of provision of services to each of the relevant countries are cumulative. Alternatively, the customer may seek provision for two types of liability cap: the individual caps referred to above and an overall cap regarding all claims arising out of the provision of services to all of the relevant countries. Clarity on these issues should be mutually advantageous.
 
 
 
Liability for breaches of data protection obligations
In this standard document the supplier’s liability under  (clauses to add to be added around data protection compliance) is capped, but the customer’s liability is not. For a discussion around the issues to consider when negotiating limits for data protection, and related liabilities, see .

   17.2  The exclusions in  and  shall apply to the fullest extent permissible at law but the Supplier does not exclude liability for:

   (a)  death or personal injury caused by the negligence of the Supplier, its officers, employees, contractors or agents;

   (b)  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;

   (c)  breach of the obligations implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 Supply of the Goods and Services Act 1982; or

   (d)  any other liability which cannot be excluded by law.

   Types of liability not excluded
 
All the terms of  are subject to , which lists the types of liability which by law the supplier may not exclude at all. Such terms are commonly included in contracts of this kind on the basis that an express acknowledgement of liability which by law may not be excluded may make the exclusions and limitations of other types of liability appear to be more reasonable. See .
 
Furthermore, it may be agreed that liability will be unlimited in specific circumstances. Common exceptions include breach of confidentiality and data security obligations. The supplier’s attitude is likely to depend on the nature of the services to be provided. If they go beyond maintenance and support and extend, for example, to migrating the customer’s key business information, the supplier may be more likely to accept the request. Another common exception concerns the intellectual property indemnity and, like the exceptions mentioned earlier, the customer’s argument is likely to be that this area is within the supplier’s control.

   17.3  The Customer acknowledges that:

   (a)  it is exclusively responsible for:

   (i)  reviewing any new Modifications in accordance with ;

   (ii)  ensuring that the staff of the Customer [and its Affiliates] are trained in the proper use and operation of the Software;

   (iii)  making regular backup copies of its data to ensure recovery of its data if the Software malfunctions; and

   (iv)  the selection, use of and results obtained from any other programs, equipment, materials or services used in conjunction with the Software;

   (b)  the level of the Charges reflects the allocation of risk between the parties set out in  and ; and

   (c)  it is in a better position than the Supplier to assess and manage its risk in relation to use of the Software.

   Customer acknowledgements
 
In transactions of higher value or importance it is prudent to expressly record various acknowledgements by the customer in order to strengthen the supplier’s position, should the customer elect later to challenge the validity of the provisions of clause 17 under  (should it apply).
 
If standard terms (as adjudged by the courts) are used, the exclusion and limitation provisions will have to meet the UCTA reasonableness test. Even if they are clearly drafted, contain an appropriate cap and the customer is fully aware of all relevant circumstances, these provisions will still be subject to UCTA, under which a wide range of factors need to be taken into account. Additional or alternative acknowledgements which may be made (if applicable) are that the customer has been induced to accept the cap in return for a lower contract price and that the parties have apportioned liability between them in light of the existence of insurance.

   17.4  All dates supplied by the Supplier for the delivery of the Modifications or the provision of Services shall be treated as approximate only. The Supplier shall not in any circumstances be liable for any loss or damage arising from any delay in delivery beyond such approximate dates.

   Delivery dates
 
This clause aims to negate any suggestion that time is of the essence regarding any of the delivery dates.

   17.5  All references to the Supplier in this  shall, for the purposes of this clause only, be treated as including all employees, subcontractors and suppliers of the Supplier and its Affiliates, all of whom shall have the benefit of the exclusions and limitations of liability set out in this clause, in accordance with .

   Extending benefit of exclusions and limitations
 
Together with , the aim of this clause is to extend the benefit of the various exclusions and limitations to include various entities representing the supplier. If the supplier is part of a group, you might wish to refer to both the supplier and its affiliates and their respective representatives.

   17.6  [The Supplier warrants and represents that it has full authority to license or sub-license the Third-Party Software to the Customer on the terms of this agreement.]

   17.7  [The Customer shall comply with the Third-Party Licences and shall indemnify the Supplier against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal and other reasonable professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by the Supplier arising out of or in connection with the Customer’s breach of the terms of any such Third-Party Licences, or any breach of this agreement by the Customer which causes the Supplier to breach the term of any Third-Party Licences.]

   Third-Party Licences (optional)
 
A customer may only be willing to accept  to  where the supplier notifies it in advance of all relevant Third-Party Software, and the terms of all relevant Third-Party Licences. This would be a reasonable request, but – depending on how much third-party software is used as part of the deliverables – may be an onerous undertaking for the supplier.
 
The customer is unlikely to find either the indemnity or its coverage of indirect loss very palatable and may in fact request that the disclaimer of indirect loss in  be made reciprocal.

   17.8  [The Supplier may treat the Customer’s breach of any Third-Party Licence as a breach of this agreement.]

   18.  ASSIGNMENT AND SUBCONTRACTING

   Assignment and subcontracting
 
Subject to the comments set out below, it is not usually unreasonable for the customer to impose a restriction on assignment and sub-licensing by the supplier since in many cases the supplier will have been chosen to provide maintenance on the basis of its expertise and experience in supporting the software and/or on the basis of its financial stability. Equally the supplier may be concerned, in the case of an assignment by the customer, about the assignee’s ability to pay the charges.
 
As the standard document is drafted to be pro-supplier,  prohibits assignment, sub-licensing and so on, by the customer without consent but provides that consent must be given where it is reasonable to do so.
 
Where the supplier consents to the customer disposing of its interest in the agreement, wholly or in part, by some means under , the supplier will need reassurance that the customer will ultimately be responsible for all of its obligations being fulfilled. If the supplier agrees to a novation in favour a particular third party, the terms of the novation agreement will typically include a release of the customer’s responsibility from some, but not all (for example, confidentiality obligations will continue), of the customer’s obligations in consideration of the third party assuming these obligations regarding the supplier.
 
On the hand,  permits assignment, sub-licensing and so on, by the supplier provided notice is given to the customer. The customer may resist this, however, and if so, there are some cases where the supplier may want to insist on a right to transfer its rights or obligations under the agreement without prior consent. For example:
 
Where the supplier does not possess sufficient or appropriate resources to provide all the services alone, it may require a contractual right to subcontract. In those cases, the customer will be concerned to ensure that the supplier remains responsible for performance of the agreement.
Where the supplier anticipates that it may be necessary, it should seek to include a right to assign to affiliates or other companies acquiring its assets.

   18.1  The Customer shall not assign, novate, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of the Supplier (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

   18.2  The Supplier may at any time assign, novate, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this agreement, provided it gives written notice to the Customer.

   18.3  Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.

   18.4  Notwithstanding , a party assigning any or all of its rights under this agreement may disclose to a proposed assignee, on a confidential basis, any information in its possession that relates to this agreement or its subject matter, the negotiations relating to it and the other party which is [reasonably] necessary to disclose for the purposes of the proposed assignment, provided that no disclosure pursuant to this  shall be made until notice of the identity of the proposed assignee has been given to the other party.

   19.  DURATION

   Duration
 
 provides for the parties to be committed for an initial fixed period after which they remain committed only for one year at a time. In most cases the supplier will want the customer to be committed to the agreement for as long as possible and, consequently, a lengthy initial fixed term should be specified. In some cases this will suit the customer. For example, where the customer has made significant investment in acquiring and implementing the software and/or where there are not many suppliers who are able to support the software, it will not want to be left without support in the short term. However, in other cases, the customer will want a short initial fixed term (for example, where it is not sure if it will be using the software on a long-term basis or where it believes that maintenance may be available from other suppliers on better terms in the future). In those situations, a compromise may have to be reached.
 
The rights of the parties to terminate the agreement on notice for any reason during the term (as opposed to rights to terminate for breach or insolvency) also have to be considered in this context. Although the customer may seek long-term commitment from the supplier, the supplier should be unwilling to give up a right to terminate on notice as it may find that it is no longer viable to support the type of software concerned. However, a compromise may be found in terms of the length of the notice period. In fact, a longer notice period may be welcomed by a supplier which has taken on additional resources to provide the services to the customer as a longer notice period may provide time for it to find new customers or reduce those resources.
 
For the reasons discussed above, the customer is unlikely to agree to relinquish the right to terminate on notice after expiry of the initial fixed term.
 
For more information on commencement and duration clauses and alternative clauses, see:
 
 and its associated drafting notes.
.

   This agreement shall be deemed to have commenced on [DATE] (Commencement Date). Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, this agreement shall continue [until [DATE] OR for [PERIOD]] (Initial Term) and shall automatically extend for [PERIOD] (Extended Term) at the end of the Initial Term and at the end of each Extended Term. [The parties may agree in writing OR [[Either party OR A party] may give [written] notice to the other [party OR parties]]], not later than [PERIOD] before the end of the Initial Term or the relevant Extended Term, to terminate this agreement at the end of the Initial Term or the relevant Extended Term, as the case may be.

   20.  TERMINATION

   Termination
 
For further guidance on termination, see  and associated drafting notes, including information on the , which came into force on 26 June 2020. See also  and, in particular,  and the commentary around  and .

   20.1  Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either party may terminate this agreement with immediate effect by giving [written] notice to the other party if:

   (a)  the other party fails to pay any amount due under this agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than [NUMBER] days after being notified [in writing] to make such payment;

   (b)  the other party commits a material breach of any [other] term of this agreement and (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of [NUMBER] days after being notified [in writing] to do so;

   Termination for material breach
 
It should be noted that the terms “material breach”, “repeatedly breaches” or a breach which is or is not “remediable” are not terms with precise legal definitions. It is not certain, for example, that a material breach equates to a repudiatory breach entitling the innocent party to terminate at common law. Consequently, there will always be some uncertainty as to the sorts of breaches which will give rise to the supplier’s right to terminate.
 
Accordingly, we have suggested that a definition be provided in this agreement, see .
 
For an examination of case law on terminating contracts for different types of breach, see .

   (c)  the other party repeatedly breaches any of the terms of this agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement;

   (d)  the other party suspends, or threatens to suspend, payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or admits inability to pay its debts or [(being a company or limited liability partnership) is deemed unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986) as if the words “it is proved to the satisfaction of the court” did not appear in sections 123(1)(e) or 123(2) of the IA 1986 OR (being a partnership) has any partner to whom any of the foregoing apply];

   (e)  the other party commences negotiations with all or any class of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its debts, or makes a proposal for or enters into any compromise or arrangement with any of its creditors [other than (being a company) for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (f)  the other party applies to court for, or obtains, a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986;

   (g)  a petition is filed, a notice is given, a resolution is passed, or an order is made, for or in connection with the winding up of the other party (being a company, limited liability partnership or partnership) [other than for the sole purpose of a scheme for a solvent amalgamation of that other party with one or more other companies or the solvent reconstruction of that other party];

   (h)  an application is made to court, or an order is made, for the appointment of an administrator, or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given or an administrator is appointed, over the other party (being a company, partnership or limited liability partnership);

   (i)  the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of that other party (being a company or limited liability partnership) has become entitled to appoint or has appointed an administrative receiver;

   (j)  a person becomes entitled to appoint a receiver over all or any of the assets of the other party or a receiver is appointed over all or any of the assets of the other party;

   (k)  a creditor or encumbrancer of the other party attaches or takes possession of, or a distress, execution, sequestration or other such process is levied or enforced on or sued against, the whole or any part of the other party’s assets and such attachment or process is not discharged within [14] days;

   (l)  any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the other party in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events mentioned in  to  (inclusive);

   (m)  the other party suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business[; or]

   (n)  [the other party’s financial position deteriorates so far as to reasonably justify the opinion that its ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement is in jeopardy[; or]]

   (o)  [any warranty given by the other party in clause [NUMBER] of this agreement is found to be untrue or misleading.]

   20.2  For the purposes of a material breach means :

   (a)  a breach of any of the obligations set out in clauses [NUMBERS]; or

   (b)  a breach that has a serious effect on the benefit the terminating party would otherwise derive from this agreement [over any [NUMBER]-month period during its term].

   20.3  Either party may terminate this agreement in accordance with .

   20.4  [The Supplier acknowledges that valid termination of this agreement by the Customer under  shall comprise a Trigger Event as that term is defined in the Licence.]

   Trigger Event under source-code escrow agreement (optional clause)
 
This clause should be included if the parties are entering into a source-code escrow agreement. The main purpose of an escrow agreement, which is entered into between the parties to a software licence and a third-party escrow agent, is to put the customer in a position where it will be able to maintain the software if the supplier becomes unable or unwilling to do so, by allowing it to access the source code for the software in certain specified circumstances (such as the insolvency of the software licensor) (see ). Those circumstances are defined in  (in connection with which this agreement is intended to be used) as Trigger Events (they will also be set out in the escrow agreement). This clause confirms what is in the specimen licence, which is that termination by the customer under the circumstances specified in this clause is a trigger event allowing the customer to request that the source code of the software is released to it by the escrow agent.

   20.5  The Supplier may, without prejudice to its other rights or remedies, terminate this agreement immediately by notice to the Customer if the Customer:

   (a)  undergoes a change of Control [which does not result in Control passing to a company that, immediately before the change in question, was an Affiliate of the Customer];

   (b)  sells all of its assets or is merged or re-organised in circumstances where it is not the surviving entity; or

   (c)  disputes the ownership or validity of the Supplier’s Intellectual Property Rights.

   Right to terminate if validity of IPR disputed
 
 provides for termination by the supplier if the customer challenges the ownership or validity of any of the supplier’s intellectual property rights. The supplier will want to prevent the customer from challenging the validity of those rights. However, the customer will resist this provision since it will want to avoid the situation where it can be left without any support.
 
A clause prohibiting challenge to the validity of any licensed intellectual property rights is an excluded restriction (though not a hardcore restriction) under the technology transfer block exemption (Article 5(1)(b)), see:
 
.
.
The supplier can avoid this difficulty in the case of exclusive licences only if, instead of placing an absolute ban on challenges to validity, it reserves the right to terminate the licence if the customer challenges validity. (Non-challenge and termination clauses solely concerning know-how are not excluded from the scope of the technology transfer block exemption (paragraph 140, Guidelines on the application of Article 101 of the TFEU to technology transfer agreements (OJ 2014 C 89/3) (Guidelines)). However, it is very unlikely that an exclusive licence to any of the supplier’s intellectual property rights would be granted pursuant to a standard maintenance agreement.
 
The Guidelines state that a right for termination can have the same effect as a no challenge clause, in particular where switching away from the supplier’s technology would result in significant loss to the customer (for example where the customer has already made specific investments for producing using the licensed technology) or where the supplier’s technology is a necessary input for the customer’s production (paragraph 136). However, the Guidelines also state that outside these scenarios, a termination clause will often not provide a significant disincentive to challenge the validity of intellectual property and therefore would not produce the same effect as a no challenge clause (paragraph 137). In these cases, a right of termination in the event of such a challenge may be acceptable on an individual assessment basis even in a non-exclusive licence, depending on the circumstances.

   20.6  This agreement shall automatically terminate on termination or expiry of the Licence, but expiry or any termination of this agreement (however caused) shall have no effect on the licences granted under the Licence.

   21.  EFFECT OF TERMINATION

   Effect of termination
 
It is important to identify the clauses and schedules which the supplier will want to continue after termination and to record them appropriately in this provision.
 
For information on clauses dealing with the consequences of termination, see the integrated drafting notes to .
 
 
TUPE
 
The parties should consider the possible impact of TUPE on exit in the (unlikely but conceivable) event that TUPE applies when the same or similar maintenance services are taken in-house or a new contractor is engaged. The customer may seek an indemnity from the supplier to cover this position. For further information, see .
 
For further information, see  and .

   21.1  Other than as set out in this agreement, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other under this agreement after its termination.

   21.2  Any provision of this agreement which expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination [or expiry] of this agreement[, including , ,  to  and  and Schedules [SCHEDULE NUMBERS]], shall remain in full force and effect.

   21.3  Termination [or expiry] of this agreement, for any reason, shall not affect the accrued rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties existing at termination [or expiry].

   21.4  Notwithstanding its obligations in this , if a party is required by any law, regulation, or government or regulatory body to retain any documents or materials containing the other party’s Confidential Information, it shall notify the other party in writing of such retention, giving details of the documents and/or materials that it must retain. The provisions of  shall continue to apply to any such documents and materials retained by a recipient party for the period of time for which they are required to be retained.

   21.5  On termination [or expiry] of this agreement for any reason, the Customer’s right to receive the Services shall cease automatically and each party shall as soon as reasonably practicable:

   (a)  return, destroy or permanently delete (as directed in writing by the other party) any documents, handbooks or other information or data provided to it by the other party containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on Confidential Information belonging to the other party. If required by the other party, it shall provide written evidence (in the form of a letter signed by its [TITLE OF RELEVANT OFFICER]) no later than [NUMBER] days after termination of this agreement that these have been destroyed and that it has not retained any copies of them (except for one copy that it may use for audit purposes only and subject to the confidentiality obligations in ), provided that the Customer may retain copies of any Supplier Confidential Information incorporated into the Software;

   (b)  return all of the other party’s equipment and materials, failing which, the other party may enter the relevant premises and take possession of them. Until these are returned or repossessed, [the party in possession] shall be solely responsible for their safe-keeping,

   and any electronic data shall be considered deleted, for the purposes of this  where it has been put beyond use by the deleting party.

   Deletion of electronic data
 
It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to “delete” electronic data. The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK’s data protection authority) has opined that the term “deletion”, in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.

   21.6  On termination [or expiry] of this agreement for any reason, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  [promptly refund such portion of the Charges as relates to the period after termination [or expiry] on a pro rata basis;]

   Refund of charges on termination (optional)
 
 has been made optional on the ground that the supplier may have priced the support services on the basis that a minimum term be satisfied. In such circumstances, the supplier may be justified in arguing that where the termination is due to any reason other than a breach of the supplier’s obligations under the agreement, the customer should not be entitled to a refund of any upfront fees paid in respect of such minimum term.

   (b)  as soon as reasonably practicable, vacate the Customer’s premises leaving them clean and tidy and removing any goods, materials or equipment belonging to it. Any goods, materials or equipment that have not been removed after [NUMBER] days after termination of this agreement may be disposed of by the Customer as it thinks fit.

   21.7  On termination of this agreement for any reason, the Customer shall immediately pay any outstanding unpaid invoices and interest due to the Supplier. The Supplier shall submit invoices for any Services that it has supplied, but for which no invoice has been submitted, and the Customer shall pay these invoices immediately on receipt.

   22.  WAIVER

   Waiver
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to .
.

   22.1  A waiver of any right or remedy is only effective if given in writing [and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent right or remedy].

   22.2  A delay or failure to exercise, or the single or partial exercise of, any right or remedy shall not waive that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

   23.  REMEDIES

   Remedies
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to . .
.

   Except as expressly provided in this agreement, the rights and remedies provided under this agreement are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law.

   24.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT

   Entire Agreement
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to .
.

   24.1  This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, promises, assurances and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.

   24.2  Each party acknowledges that in entering into this agreement it does not rely on[, and shall have no remedies in respect of,] any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this agreement.

   24.3  Each party agrees that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation [or negligent misstatement] based on any statement in this agreement.

   24.4  [Nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.]

   25.  VARIATION

   Variation
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to .
.

   No variation of this agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties (or their authorised representatives).

   26.  SEVERANCE

   Severance
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to .
.

   26.1  If any provision or part-provision of this agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this agreement.

   26.2  If [one party gives notice to the other of the possibility that] any provision or part-provision of this agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend such provision so that, as amended, it is legal, valid and enforceable, and, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the intended commercial result of the original provision.

   27.  COUNTERPARTS

   Counterparts
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
Drafting notes to .
.

   27.1  This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall constitute a duplicate original, but all the counterparts shall together constitute the one agreement.

   27.2  [Transmission of [an executed counterpart of this agreement (but for the avoidance of doubt not just a signature page) OR the executed signature page of a counterpart of this agreement] by [(a) fax or (b)] email (in PDF, JPEG or other agreed format) shall take effect as the transmission of an executed “wet-ink” counterpart of this agreement. [If [this OR either] method of transmission is adopted, without prejudice to the validity of the agreement thus made, each party shall on request provide the other[s] with the “wet ink” hard copy original[s] of their counterpart.]]

   27.3  [No counterpart shall be effective until each party has [provided OR delivered] to the other[s] at least one executed counterpart.]

   28.  THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

   Third-party rights
 
If the supplier is part of a group and delegates the provision of certain elements of the services to its affiliates, you might wish to refer to both the supplier and its affiliates as beneficiaries (of, for example, the exclusions and limitations of liability provisions). Optional text regarding these circumstances is provided in the clause. Refer also to .
 
Otherwise, it is unlikely that there will be third-party beneficiaries in a maintenance agreement. It is particularly unlikely that the supplier would wish any other companies to benefit from the agreement unless, where the supplier is not the software owner, its agreement with the software owner (permitting the supplier to support the software) specifies that terms for the support of the software are required to be directly enforceable by the software owner against the supplier’s customers. It is more likely that the customer will wish third parties (for example, affiliates) to benefit. There are two main reasons why this should be resisted by the supplier:
 
The inclusion of specific references to third parties impliedly extends the circumstances which the supplier has in contemplation at the date of contract, thus extending its potential exposure to claims under the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale [1854] 9 Exch 341.
The supplier is unlikely to be prepared to deal with a multiplicity of claims or enforcement actions, particularly in what is unlikely to be a high-value contract.
For more information and an alternative clause, see .
 
See also, .

   No one other than a party to this agreement[, their successors and permitted assignees,] shall have any right to enforce any of its terms.

   OR

   28.1  Except as provided in  a person who is not a party to this agreement shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists, or is available, apart from that Act.

   28.2  The rights of the parties to terminate, rescind or agree any variation, waiver or settlement under this agreement are not subject to the consent of any person that is not a party to this agreement.

   29.  NO PARTNERSHIP OR AGENCY

   No partnership or agency

   29.1  Nothing in this agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership or joint venture between any of the parties, constitute any party the agent of another party, nor authorise any party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other party [except as expressly provided in clause[s] [NUMBER(S)]].

   29.2  Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.

   30.  FORCE MAJEURE

   Force majeure
 
For more information on this clause, see:
 
The drafting notes to .
.

   30.1  Neither party shall be in breach of this agreement or otherwise liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations if such delay or failure results from events, circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control. The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended accordingly. If the period of delay or non-performance continues for [NUMBER] [weeks OR months], the party not affected may terminate this agreement by giving [NUMBER] [days’] written notice to the affected party.

   30.2  If termination occurs under , all sums paid to the Supplier by the Customer under this agreement shall be refunded to the Customer, except that the Supplier shall be entitled to payment on a quantum meruit basis for all work done before termination, provided that the Supplier takes all reasonable steps to mitigate the amount due.

   31.  NOTICES

   Notices
 
For more information and an alternative clause, see the integrated drafting notes to  and .
 
Regarding this , decide whether or not to include emails as a formal communication channel.

   31.1  Any notice given to a party under or in connection with this agreement shall be in writing and shall be:

   (a)  delivered by hand or by pre-paid first-class post or other next working day delivery service at its registered office (if a company) or its principal place of business (in any other case)[; or]

   (b)  sent by email to the following addresses (or an address substituted in writing by the party to be served):

   (i)  Party 1: [ADDRESS].

   (ii)  Party 2: [ADDRESS].

   31.2  Any notice shall be deemed to have been received:

   (a)  if delivered by hand, at the time the notice is left at the proper address;

   (b)  if sent by [pre-paid first-class post or other] next working day delivery service, at [9.00 am] on the [second] Business Day after posting[; or]

   (c)  [if sent by email, at the time of transmission, or, if this time falls outside Business Hours in the place of receipt, when Business Hours resume.]

   31.3  This clause does not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action or, where applicable, any arbitration or other method of dispute resolution.

   32.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION

   Dispute resolution
 
The inclusion of a provision such as  is a matter of personal preference. While a requirement that disputes be referred to an internal escalation process can result in problems being dealt with quickly and at an appropriate level, it can also prolong and exacerbate disagreements.
 
Other types of dispute resolution may also be appropriate (such as expert determination for disputes over technical issues), and arbitration or alternative dispute resolution clauses should also be considered. See, .
 
For information on multi-tiered dispute resolution procedure clauses, see the integrated drafting notes to .

   32.1  It is the intention of the parties to settle amicably by negotiation all disagreements and differences of opinion on matters of [performance,] procedure and management arising out of this agreement. Accordingly, it is agreed that the procedure set out in this  shall be followed [before the serving of written notice terminating this agreement, or] in relation to any matter of dispute between the parties concerning [performance,] procedure or management.

   32.2  If any disagreement or difference of opinion arises out of this agreement, the matter shall be disposed of as follows:

   (a)  the Manager and the Support Manager shall meet to attempt resolution. Should they not meet within [14] days of the date on which either party convenes a meeting to resolve the matter, or should they not be able to resolve the matter with [14] days of first meeting; then

   (b)  the matter shall promptly be referred by either party to the [INDIVIDUAL’S POSITION] of the Customer and the [INDIVIDUAL’S POSITION] of the Supplier for immediate resolution.
