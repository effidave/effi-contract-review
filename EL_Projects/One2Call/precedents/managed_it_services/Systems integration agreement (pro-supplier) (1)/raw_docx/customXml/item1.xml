              <paratext>Within these types, individual agreements will vary widely depending on the system, the customer's business and the use to which the system is put. An agreement for a new air traffic control system, for example, will have to deal with very different issues to those in an agreement for an upgraded payroll-account system. Indeed, there will be significant differences between agreements to upgrade the payroll-accounts system of a multinational company and those of a small, local firm.</paratext>

These include provision for country-specific amendments, extension of the benefit of software and services to affiliates and various measures to increase supplier's liability under the agreement.

              <paratext>The standard document illustrates the basic issues that need to be considered in all systems integration agreements that include some software modification or development. The development and modification of software are usually the hardest parts of the project to deal with in the agreement, and the most usual cause of disputes between suppliers and customers.</paratext>

            <para>
              <paratext>The standard document is generally drafted from the perspective of the supplier. However, both parties should regard it as being in their own interest to negotiate an agreement which is fairly balanced, as this will make the project more likely to proceed smoothly with few disputes. A party who feels that it has been forced into a bad bargain by the negotiating strength and leverage of the other party is more likely to be looking for a way out if things go wrong. There are almost always implementation problems when software development or integration is involved.</paratext>

                <paratext>Each party should carry out due diligence before entering into the agreement. They should find out what the IPR position is, and in particular, what licences are necessary for the project to go ahead and the effect of the existing contractual terms under the local law applicable to where the services are to be provided.

              <para>
                <paratext>In order to use pre-existing software, the customer needs a licence from the owner of the rights in the software (or from someone who has been granted rights to sub-license the software by the owner). Copyright is infringed by a number of acts, including the unauthorised copying of the copyright work. Since the mere act of loading software into a computer involves copying it onto its memory, a licence is required even for the most basic use of a computer program. If there is a patent, the use of software that is covered by any valid claim of that patent will also be patent infringement unless it is made under a licence. The precise scope of the licence is, however, a matter for negotiation between the parties (see <internal.reference refid="a449338"><ital>clause 18</ital></internal.reference>).</paratext>
              </para>
              <para>
                <paratext>Making a derivative work can also be an infringement of copyright and, if it comes within a claim of the patent, patent infringement. Standard software licences almost always exclude, to the extent legally possible, the right to modify the software. While UK law does give a right to <link href="6-107-6053" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><bold><ital>decompile</ital></bold></link> software in order to obtain information that is needed to make that program operate with another independent program, that only relates to copyright. In any event it would be unwise to rely on that right as it is limited and untested in the courts (see <link href="7-107-4789#a621987" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>Practice note, Main issues in software licensing and maintenance contracts: Acts specifically permitted</ital></link>). To avoid liability for infringement, therefore, the supplier must get the rights-owner's permission for pre-existing software to be modified for use in the customer's system.</paratext>

              <para>
                <paratext>The issue of ownership of the rights in any newly developed software is usually difficult to resolve. Unless specified to the contrary in the agreement, the default statutory position is that the supplier will own these. The customer often takes the position that, having paid for the software to be developed, it wants to own the rights in it. However, software is very rarely written from scratch; it is usually constructed using existing modules which the software developer has developed in previous projects and which it will want to use again for other customers. This means that the supplier will not usually agree to transfer ownership of all rights.</paratext>

              <para>
                <paratext>It would be impractical for the customer to verify the supplier's claims of ownership of the software and of the right to license its use. Accordingly, the customer will want to ensure that it is contractually protected if the supplier is not, in fact, so entitled. This protection is necessary in case the IPRs in all or part of the software actually belong to someone else, and the licensor has not given the supplier the right to grant sub-licences. This may happen even where the software was written by the supplier, for example, in cases where it has transferred the IPRs in the software to a previous customer. It can also be relevant if, in writing the software, an employee of the supplier copied code from a pre-existing program belonging to a third party. In those situations, use of the software by the customer would constitute a breach of the third-party IPRs in the software and would expose the customer to the risk of an infringement action.</paratext>
              </para>
              <para>
                <paratext>It is therefore usual for the supplier to provide some protection for the customer against claims that the software infringes any third-party IPRs, commonly in the form of a contractual indemnity (see <internal.reference refid="a434982"><ital>clause 30</ital></internal.reference>). This may be subject to a capped amount and should exclude infringement caused by the customer's own activities (see <internal.reference refid="a255633"><ital>clause 30.2</ital></internal.reference>). The customer will often contend that the supplier should remain liable for infringements arising from use of the software or hardware it supplies in conjunction with other software or hardware which it knew was required to implement and use the system, for example, the operating system or standard database software.</paratext>

              <para>
                <paratext>There is uncertainty as to whether a contract for the provision of bespoke software is legally classified as a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for the provision of services, although the tax authorities have their own tests. In the case of systems integration agreements, the classification may depend on the ratio of the value of goods (standard software) to services (modifications, bespoke software and integration) in the contract. The draftsperson needs to keep in mind the provisions of legislation and case law relating to both types of contract, particularly in the area of <link href="6-107-7496" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><bold><ital>warranties</ital></bold></link> and limitation of liability.</paratext>

The customer will usually seek warranties as to the performance of the system, so as to ensure that there are legal remedies available to it if there are serious problems with the system's performance. The supplier should not in general offer such warranties, and, if they are required as part of the negotiated agreement, they should be tied strictly to demonstrable performance standards, which should be contained in an agreed technical specification (see <internal.reference refid="a909529"><ital>Drafting note, Warranties</ital></internal.reference>). This is not necessarily bad for the customer, as it results in standards of performance that can readily be measured, and failure to meet those standards will be much easier to prove in a dispute.</paratext>

                <paratext>The agreement must make clear the point at which the customer accepts the system. This is because after acceptance the customer has no general legal right to reject the system if it is defective and get its money back, and can only sue for damages. The supplier should seek to obtain a legally binding acceptance as early as possible, while the customer will try to delay the point in time at which it must accept the system until it has had time to fully test the system in normal use. Normally a compromise is reached through acceptance testing provisions (see <internal.reference refid="a328837"><ital>clause 12</ital></internal.reference>).</paratext>

Going forward, companies entering into new agreements after December 2020 will also be able to benefit from the retained exemptions, provided they meet the relevant criteria. However, companies should be aware that UK courts and authorities may be able to divert from previous EU interpretation of the block exemptions, most likely where there are material differences in UK and EU legislation or markets, even if this is initially unlikely. Looking to the future, some divergence between EU and UK competition law may be expected as the application of EU and UK competition develops.

The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps.

But depending on the bargaining strengths of the parties, the supplier may require the customer to comply with the supplier's business policies for reputational reasons, for example.

                <paratext>There are often significant differences in size and bargaining power between parties to system integration agreements. There are a few very large suppliers of IT services who have considerable experience in most of the usual types of system integration projects. They tend to have standard terms which are favourable to them and refuse to make any significant changes except for very large customers, such as national governments. On the other hand, there are small specialised supplier firms who have to deal with customers who are much more powerful than them. For example, such firms with expertise in very sophisticated financial software may be negotiating with large and powerful banks and financial institutions. In practice, it is not in the long-term interest of the more powerful party to insist on a one-sided contract, as this tends to lead to disputes. Another risk of this approach is that, where the contract is obviously unfair, the courts are more likely to apply <link href="7-505-7728" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>UCTA</ital></link> and other legal principles in favour of the weaker party.</paratext>

This is a means of ensuring that the customer will be able to continue to support the software, either itself or through a third-party maintainer, if the supplier fails to do so adequately or at all. While this situation may arise due to insolvency, the customer may insist that this is not the only trigger for release of the escrowed code, as suppliers who are in financial trouble tend to provide inadequate maintenance long before they become officially insolvent.</paratext>

                      <paratext>Except for very simple systems, the supplier is advised to produce a technical specification, which will set out the measurable deliverables and performance criteria that are necessary to achieve the business requirements. The supplier should also obtain the customer's written agreement that this technical specification meets their specified business requirements. This agreed technical specification will then act as the yardstick against which performance of the supplier's obligations is measured. If the supplier cuts corners by failing to prepare a proper technical specification, or agrees to have its performance measured against the customer's business requirements specification, it may find that, while the system is developed, it is trying to hit a vague or moving target, with ample scope for disagreement as to whether the requirements have been met. Having an accurate and detailed technical specification reduces the chance of disagreements over whether or not the supplier has met its obligations.</paratext>

                      <paratext>This definition is relevant to the supplier's and customer's obligations under clauses 21 and 25 respectively. It is important to tie it to something that can be measured objectively so that there is a standard against which the supplier's obligations can be measured. Specifying the documentation, as in the standard document, will require the supplier to ensure that the documentation is precise, complete and up to date, but such clarity will be mutually advantageous. The "substantially" limitation in the definition does introduce some uncertainty, but without it the supplier would be obliged to fix all faults, however trivial. A trivial fault could be difficult and expensive to fix, and might not even affect the customer's use of the system.</paratext>

                  <paratext>It is rare for a brand new system to be installed. The customer will almost always have an existing system which the supplier is going to either upgrade or replace. In either event, the supplier will need to have both physical and remote access to the existing system (hardware and software) and to the customer's data. This need for access (<internal.reference refid="a574304"><ital>clause 25</ital></internal.reference>) has to be balanced against the customer's need to go on running its business while the new system is being developed. The customer must have an obligation to co-operate in carrying out the work, in particular to allow the supplier's staff reasonable access to information and the site, and to provide necessary supplies for the supplier's personnel working on the customer's site. The customer may want more control over rights of access than this clause gives, but the supplier must be careful not to end up in a situation where the project cannot be completed on time because access is not provided, or where it ends up paying its personnel overtime from its own pocket because access is only given outside normal working hours (unless this expense has been factored into the agreed price at the beginning) (<internal.reference refid="a574304"><ital>clause 25</ital></internal.reference>). The customer may also require that the supplier accept an obligation of responsible conduct to go with the right of access (<internal.reference refid="a293196"><ital>clause 23</ital></internal.reference>).</paratext>

In any other case, both parties have an interest in having pre-installation testing carried out. For the supplier, this allows for testing in a controlled environment and the opportunity to correct obvious errors and deal with problems before the customer sees the software. The customer also benefits, as its employees and business are not disrupted by problems with totally untested software. Clause 10.3 provides a mechanism for dealing with repeated material failure to pass the agreed pre-installation tests. The relevant periods (in square brackets in the standard document) will have to be agreed in the light of the implementation plan as a whole and the complexity of both the system and the software.</paratext>

This is often done by having a schedule setting out the milestones (specified events) and the amount payable on achievement of each milestone. The customer will probably seek to have these payments heavily weighted towards the final stages of the project, but the supplier should point out that it is not in the customer's interest to cause the supplier severe cash-flow problems, which in the case of a small company could put its future at risk either during the project or during any subsequent maintenance period.</paratext>

                      <paratext>Schedule 4 should state when payments on any invoice are due, and permit the supplier to charge interest on late payments. Suppliers should also reserve the right to suspend work or even terminate the agreement for a failure to pay after an extended period or repeated late payments. Failure to receive regular payments on time can cause severe cash-flow problems to a small supplier who must, in any event, continue to pay its employees or contractors regularly. The customer may seek to have a provision allowing it to withhold disputed amounts during dispute resolution. If the supplier agrees to this, there must be a provision for interest to be payable on any amount that the supplier is found to be entitled to at the end of the dispute resolution procedure.</paratext>

                  <paratext>However, changes made to the system during implementation can lead to delays and/or increases in cost. One of the difficulties of system integration projects is that the customer can rarely define exactly what it wants before any system integration work begins. During development it is common to find that an alternative would work better, or for the users in the customer's organisation to discover that new software can add functionality, which they want but could not achieve with the old system. It follows that procedures to vary what is to be provided are essential in any system integration agreement.</paratext>

                  <paratext>Unless this change process is carefully controlled, the changes can cause serious delay and price escalation. Allowing uncontrolled variation is a proven recipe for disaster and dispute, particularly when the supplier's personnel are working closely with the customer's employees and therefore want to be helpful and provide whatever is asked for. Variations almost always add to the cost of the project and the time needed for completion. If it is a fixed-price contract, the supplier suffers, and if it is on a time-and-materials basis, the customer finds the system is more expensive than expected. In addition, both parties are affected by the extra time needed. Both parties, therefore, have an interest in controlling the variations that are made and the process by which they are agreed and incorporated in the main contract.</paratext>

                    <paratext>Agreed variations to the agreement must be recorded in a written document (defined as a Change Agreement in clause 1 by reference to clause 16.3). There is an inherent conflict between certainty and progress on the project. From the lawyer's point of view, no work should proceed on a variation until a formal change agreement has been agreed and signed, therefore giving legal certainty as to the scope of the contract. Unfortunately this can take time, and meanwhile the parties will want to press on with work on the project. If work is to commence before the change agreement is agreed and signed, there has to be some mechanism for resolving disputes over the change agreement and dealing with a situation where the parties cannot reach an agreement, but work has been done on implementing the variation.</paratext>

The customer may object to this, especially with respect to the customised software for which it has paid the development costs. The supplier should strive to retain ownership although it may, as a compromise, agree not to license third parties to use the customised software or those particular modifications of the standard software that have been tailor-made for the customer. However, it would be prudent to limit this restriction to a specified period to minimise the risk of breaching UK or EU competition law, see <internal.reference refid="a473962"><ital>Drafting note, Competition issues</ital></internal.reference>.</paratext>

                    <paratext>The optional non-solicitation provisions in clause 23.3 are primarily for the protection of the supplier. It is common for customers to want to hire the key supplier employee who has been responsible for the system integration once the system is up and running, as this enables them to bypass the supplier for much of the ongoing maintenance.</paratext>

The clause should always be mutual, and care should be taken to make the period reasonable. It should be proportionate to the importance of the system to the customer's business and the length of time taken to complete the system integration project. If a court determines that either the period or scope of the restraint is not reasonable, it will be unenforceable.</paratext>

                      <paratext>In the interest of a successful outcome (which both parties share), it is reasonable to have a contractual agreement that the supplier will not remove the project manager (or any other key member of its team) from the project before final acceptance (see <internal.reference refid="a772293"><ital>clause 24.5</ital></internal.reference>). This is to ensure that highly skilled personnel, who are essential to the success of the project, are not reassigned by the supplier if a more lucrative project comes along. However, the supplier will usually resist agreeing to an absolute prohibition on moving personnel between projects (which could make its business impossible to manage efficiently). However, it should be prepared to agree that a few key individuals (and certainly the project manager) will not be removed without the customer's consent. There should also be a mechanism for allowing the customer to request the removal of an individual and to be consulted about any proposed replacement before the change is made.</paratext>

Also, the express exclusion of other warranties under <internal.reference refid="a286105"><ital>clause 29.4</ital></internal.reference> is more likely to be deemed reasonable (and therefore enforceable) if a reasonable warranty of performance has been given. Another advantage of giving an express warranty is that the remedy for breach can be limited, either by monetary amount or by the action to be taken by the supplier, as here. <internal.reference refid="a902255"><ital>Clause 29.5</ital></internal.reference> is an important protection for the supplier, who should never promise to fix all defects, as this may be impossible.

                    <paratext>For these reasons, suppliers are likely to want to resist any attempt by the customer to make them liable for any breach of these security standards, unless such requirements have been agreed in advance by the parties as part of the Business Requirements Specification or the Technical Specification, and particular limits of liability have been agreed in relation to the allocation of any regulatory fines, and other liabilities, that might result from any such security issues. The supplier will most likely want to argue that it is the customer who understands its own business operations (and its reliance on the System as part of those business operations) the best, in order to decide what security measures are appropriate in the circumstances. Alternatively, the supplier may wish to charge the customer an additional consulting fee for providing cybersecurity advice.</paratext>

                    <paratext>It can be difficult for organisations (particularly suppliers) to agree to "delete" electronic data. The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and it is recognised that it is not always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. As the ICO (the UK's data protection authority) has opined that the term "deletion", in relation to personal data, should be taken to mean ensuring that the data is beyond use, we consider this is a reasonable deletion standard to use in most circumstances. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, we recommend that a party should also be expected to delete it from any back-up of the information on that system, and the parties may prefer for this to be made explicit as part of the deletion obligation.</paratext>

                  <paratext>Disputes between supplier and customer almost inevitably arise during systems integration projects, most commonly from failures to communicate. On the supplier's side, there is a natural reluctance to admit that things are not going to plan, so the customer may only become aware that there is a problem when it has become so great as to threaten the whole project.

However, to leave the decision about the alternative method of resolving a dispute until the dispute has actually arisen is also a recipe for disaster as there may already be hurt feelings and a lack of trust at that point. It is, therefore, important that a carefully considered method of dealing with disputes is agreed and written into the contract before the project begins.</paratext>

First, there must be a formal step for starting the procedure (<internal.reference refid="a968174"><ital>clause 45.2</ital></internal.reference>). Initially, the supplier's project manager and the customer's project director should try to resolve the dispute if possible (<internal.reference refid="a560289"><ital>clause 45.4(a)</ital></internal.reference>). Many disputes can be nipped in the bud by good collaboration between these individuals so it is important that they have a good working relationship.</paratext>

However, this will only be successful if the senior managers have responsibility for, and ownership of, the project in their respective organisations and sufficient authority to take potentially risky decisions that are binding on their company. It is a good idea to provide for maximum time periods for both levels of discussion, as delay in resolving the dispute could itself endanger the project. On the other hand, the best settlement is always one reached by the parties themselves, so sufficient time should be allowed for this to happen.</paratext>

Arbitration and litigation both have their advantages and disadvantages, but neither is quick or cheap. You may wish to consider the arbitration services offered by the London Court of International Arbitration and the International Chamber of Commerce. The standard document attempts to assign the more suitable form to each of the potential kinds of technical and legal disputes, but there can even be disputes over the nature of the dispute. If arbitration is to be used, there should be provision in the agreement (Annex 9) for at least the basic rules and procedure to be followed as, unlike in litigation, there is no single, legally binding standard set of rules. Again, leaving these to be decided only after a dispute has arisen could lead to stalemate and the collapse of the project.</paratext>

                    <paratext>Unless the situation is so serious that the agreement is terminated, both parties have an interest in continuing performance during the period the dispute is being dealt with. The customer should be required to make payments to the supplier pending resolution of the dispute. As a fall-back position, the customer should only have the right to withhold payments relating to matters in dispute, and the supplier needs to be certain that, once the dispute is resolved, it promptly receives any money that is found to be due. One solution is for the customer to pay the disputed sums into an escrow account. This is particularly important where the supplier has doubts about the ability or willingness of the customer to make the payments, and it prevents such a customer from raising artificial disputes in order to delay making payments.</paratext>

                <paratext>Systems integration agreements typically have several schedules, which will contain details of matters and items to be provided under the agreement. The contract is more manageable if these details are in separate schedules at the end of the agreement rather than being set out in the body of the agreement, but the agreement must make it clear that these are contractual terms and conditions. It should also provide for possible conflicts between these documents (see <internal.reference refid="a537560"><ital>Drafting note, Structure and content of agreement</ital></internal.reference>).</paratext>

                <paratext>Where there are related agreements, for example, the software licence and maintenance agreement, they should be annexed to the main agreement. Annexation means that the agreements will be interpreted as related agreements. It also has the practical benefit of keeping all the agreements readily to hand in one place. The customer may assert that it is relying on representations made by the supplier in the response to the invitation to tender, in which case it will want to have these documents annexed to the main agreement. The supplier should strongly resist this, and may offer instead to incorporate in the agreement those specific representations the customer wants to rely on (see <internal.reference refid="a537560"><ital>Drafting note, Structure and content of agreement</ital></internal.reference> and <internal.reference refid="a260484"><ital>Drafting note, Entire agreement</ital></internal.reference>).</paratext>

                <paratext>This annex must contain details of the tests to be carried out and the criteria that must be met in order for the tests to be successful. Ideally, the annex will be finalised before the systems integration project begins. However, in reality it is very rare for it to be completed before work begins for any but the simplest systems. This is because with most systems there has to be a preliminary period while the design is refined in the light of detailed discussions between the customer and supplier. Both tests and performance criteria will need to be amended to match the final design. If an acceptance testing procedure is not agreed by the time the systems integration agreement is signed, the agreement will need to have provisions dealing with how a procedure is to be agreed.</paratext>
