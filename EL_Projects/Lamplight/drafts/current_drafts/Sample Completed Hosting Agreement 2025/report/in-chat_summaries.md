Priority actions identified:

High: Add annual price review clause (currently locked at £35/month)
Medium: Update GDPR references for UK post-Brexit
Medium: Add explicit data export right on termination
Medium: Clarify IP indemnity is subject to liability cap
Low: Add notices clause and update "writing" definition to include email
Cross-cutting concerns flagged:

Liability cap / indemnity interaction ambiguity
No super-cap for data protection claims
Customer is a charity — UCTA acknowledgments help but consider adding commercial capacity warranty

----------

Key findings:

Overall: Lamplight terms are broadly equivalent on core risk allocation but weaker on commercial protection mechanisms
Top 2 priorities: (1) Add price escalation clause; (2) Add data return mechanism with time limit and cost recovery
Medium priorities: Fix the "writing excludes email" issue, add notices clause, update UK GDPR references, add licence restrictions, add express supplier assignment right
Strengths in Lamplight terms: Acceptance tests clause, detailed Appendix 3 (DR/backup), security acknowledgements, warranty time limit, negotiation acknowledgement for UCTA
The comparison confirms the Pass 1 findings while identifying specific precedent clauses that can be used as drafting models for the recommended updates.

I've made the following amendments to the Hosting Agreement, each with an explanatory comment:

High Priority Changes:

Clause 1.7 - Writing definition – Changed from "includes faxes but not e-mail" to "includes email" so formal notices sent by email are now effective

New Clause 3.1A - Price escalation – Added right for Lamplight to increase fees annually with 60 days' notice (supports charging flexibility)

New Clause 13.6 - Data return mechanism – Customers have 14 days post-termination to request data return; thereafter Lamplight may delete

Medium Priority Changes:

GDPR references – Updated "GDPR" to "UK GDPR" throughout and changed "EEA" references to "UK" (4 occurrences updated)

New Clause 2.2.5 - Licence restrictions – Added standard SaaS restrictions on reverse engineering, competitive use, and sublicensing

New Clause 14.2A - Supplier assignment right – Express right for Lamplight to assign without customer consent (critical for business sale)

New Clause 14.7 - Notices – Standard notices clause with deemed receipt provisions

Each amendment has a comment (by "Legal Review") explaining the change in accessible, practical terms. The document is ready for client review.

----------

Now I have a clear picture of the precedent's structure. Let me make the transformations to convert the Lamplight agreement into online T&Cs. I'll need to:

Add an introductory clause about online acceptance
Add definitions for online ordering (Order Details, Online Order Confirmation, etc.)
Add an Orders clause for online ordering process
Add a trial period mechanism
Update the recitals and structure for online format
Remove signature blocks

----------

Now I have a complete picture. Let me make the transformations to convert this into online T&Cs. I'll need to:

Replace the bespoke contract header/recitals with online terms format
Add new definitions for online ordering
Add an "Orders" clause for online sign-up
Add trial period provisions
Update structure references
Add deemed acceptance language
Let me start making these changes:
