Notes from proposal – JD edit;

Clause:

Comment:

SLA
4.7

I note this states that “the target response level for the aforementioned service levels is set at 80%, relative to the agreed support hours provided by the Company”. I understand this to mean that the Service Levels in clause 4 will only be met by One2Call 80% of the time. This feels low, would expect 90-95%+ ?

SLA 7 Exclusions

A very minor point but, the numbering in this clause is a little strange as I think 7.2 – 7.15 inclusive should all come under clause 7.1, as 7.1.1 – 7.1.14.

SLA 9.2

This clause states that the frequency and content of service review meetings/reports will align with the stipulations outlined in the relevant contract. Is it envisaged that various contracts will be entered into from time to time under this agreement? If so, each contract will need to be checked – ie. We want to sign off pre- signature I think

SLA 9.3

A contract review meeting will be held between One2Call and the designated Customer Contract Manager approximately four months before contract renewal only where Milewood requests this. Please can we have this as a guaranteed meeting that One2 Call will arrange.

SLA 10.3.4

If a hardware-related Incident is logged against an item within the manufacturer's warranty, One2Call will coordinate with the third party to obtain the replacement part. However, at this point, the SLA ceases to be applicable. The third party may provide labour for the replacement part, or One2Call will provide the labour as per the contract. Should the SLA not apply to any replacement item provided?

11

This clause states that some downtime may apply. No downtime limit is set for maintenance and no service credits are offered if downtime goes beyond a certain percentage. Should we get credits / safety net of some sort here eg. if downtime is excessive we may want to terminate / be remedied?

13.4 and 13.5

Resolution work outside of standard hours will incur charges as specified in the order. Can we get the order please and confirm the extra charges? Probably needs to be clear that Milewood would like to approve charges before work is actioned unless an emergency?

14

Clause 14 refers to a “Change Control” process which is a defined term, but I cannot find where in the agreement this is defined. This is for the parties to agree changes to the Service mutually, but the agreement does not set out how this will be done. Can we please clarify this as it also contradicts clause 15.1 as discussed below.

15.1

This clause rather contradicts clause 14 which states that any proposed changes to the Services shall be made by mutual agreement and a written change request.

Clause 15.1 states that One2Call “retains the right to make modifications to these conditions at its discretion. The Customer will be bound by any revised conditions effective from the date of such changes. While the Company will make efforts to furnish the Customer with updated versions, it remains the Customer's responsibility to periodically check the Company's website at  for any amendments. Posting changes to these conditions on  will be considered sufficient notice to the Customer of such changes.” 

This is very risky for Milewood so we’d like to propose the following wording;

“No addition to variation of, exclusion or attempted exclusion of these conditions shall be binding on the parties unless in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of each party.” 

This wording is taken from clause 2.2 of the Terms (below) so it is One2Call’s own clause and just adapted to “these conditions” to fit with the terms used in the SLA so they should find this acceptable.

Standard Terms & Conditions of Business (Terms)

The opening paragraph states that the Standard Terms & Conditions of Business are dated 16 May 2023. These should not be backdated and should be dated on the date the agreement is entered into.

“Data 
Protection 
Laws” 
definition and 
“EU Data 
Protection 
Laws” 
Definition.

These are focused on EU legislation and seem outdated or inappropriate. I understand both parties are based in England so this should refer to English legislation including the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2426). Will personal data be processed in Europe? Are EU Data Protection Laws applicable?

“Charges” and 
“Fee” 
definitions.

There seems to be some duplication here. I am not sure why both are needed. Neither defined terms seem to be used as fees and charges in the document are not capitalised. This creates some lack of clarity.

“Minimum 
Term” 
definition

This means “any minimum term for the provision of Services set out in an Order Form. Does this mean this could be a different period to that set out in the Master Service Agreement? Each Order Form will therefore be checked. It should be clarified what the Minimum Term is, as, from reading the Master Service Agreement, we understood this to be 24 months, however this definition implies it may be a different time period depending on each Order. This is important for clause 8.1 and 8.2 as discussed below.

“The Terms,
Commission, 
Controller….”

This should not refer to the GDPR, but should refer to all applicable laws relating to the protection of personal data and the privacy of individuals, including the UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2426).

1.7

Clauses 1.7, 2.1.2 and 2.3 all seem contradictory in terms of which document has priority if there is a conflict. This should be clarified and corrected. 

Clause 1.7 states that, in the event of a conflict between the General Terms and Conditions and the Services Term (being any specific terms and conditions set out separately or within a Service Agreement or with an Order which are specific to the Services being delivered) or the Order, the Service Terms will prevail over these Terms and the Order will prevail over the Service Terms. So the order of priority in the case of a conflict of terms is (1) what is in the Order (2) What is set out in any Service Term and then what is set out in these General Terms & Conditions. It will therefore be important to check any Order or any Special Terms agreed to ensure there are no clauses included which will override these General Terms & Conditions.

2.1.1 and 2.3

Clause 2.1.2 then seems to contradict clause 1.7 saying “These conditions and the schedules shall:… Prevail over any inconsistent terms or conditions between the parties, including but not limited to those contained in or referred to in the customers purchase order, confirmation of order, or specification, or implied by law, trade custom, practice or course of dealing.” So this now suggests the General Terms & Conditions prevail over the purchase order although the defined term of Order is not used. Clarification should be sought to make sure Milewood understands which document prevails. 

Clause 2.3 then further contradicts this stating: 
“If there is a conflict between any of the provisions of these General Terms & Conditions and any provisions of any schedule (including any conditions within the order and any service terms incorporated therein) the conflict will be resolved according to the following order of priority:
2.3.1First: these General Terms & Conditions;
2.3.2Second: the conditions set out in the Order;
2.3.3Third: the relevant service schedule; and
2.3.4Fourth: any addendum to these General Terms & Conditions”..

So this suggest a different order of priority again.

2.2 and 13.16

This clause states “No addition to variation of, exclusion or attempted exclusion of any term of the contract shall be binding on the parties unless in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of each party.” However, clause 13.16 then contradicts this stating “One2call may change this Agreement (Terms and Conditions, AUP, and the Service Level Agreement) from time to time. In the event of a material adverse change One2call will give the Client at least ninety (90) days’ notice before the change is to take effect, save where compliance with any legal or regulatory obligation requires a shorter period of notice or no notice. The Client’s continued use of the Services following any such changes shall constitute the Client’s acceptance of such changes.”
Please we remove 13.16 as clause 2.2 should apply, given (as discussed above in the SLA re clause 15) that Milewood is tied in for the Minimum Period

5.7

Clause 5.7 contains an indemnity under which Milewood must indemnify One2Call in respect of any costs, claims, damages or liabilities arising from any delay or failure by Milewood to comply with the provisions of this clause 5. This is a wide and onerous indemnity. An indemnity is usually in respect of a specific risk. Here I would suggest trying to avoid giving an indemnity on the basis that One2Call should make a claim for a breach of clause 5 and prove and mitigate its losses. If One2Call will not accept this, I would suggest amending the indemnity clause as follows:

“The Client hereby acknowledges and agrees that One2call shall not be liable for any delay or failure to comply with its obligations hereunder, and shall indemnify One2call in full and on demand in respect of any reasonable costs, claims, damages or liabilities arising from any delay or failure by the Client to comply with the provisions of this clause 5 and One2call shall mitigate its losses. The Client shall have no liability under this clause 5.7 where One2call is at fault”

6.1

One2Call reserves the right to increase the Charges and will give at least 30 days’ written notice of any such intention. Given there is no cap here or no limit to volume of increases, can we please build in a tolerance of 10% & no more than once per year?

6.4

Unless otherwise expressly set out to the contrary in the applicable Order Forms, Milewood must pay all expenses reasonably incurred by One2call that are attributable to the provision of the Goods and/or Services. This will include the cost of travel outside Working Hours to and from supported sites, attendance at meetings, and preparation of reports, telephone charges and courier costs. Can we set a limit where Milewood will approve eg above £xx?

7.2

The maximum aggregate liability of One2Call (which also includes its respective agents and sub-contractors) shall not exceed four times the total Charges paid by Milewood under the relevant Order. Is this amount reasonable given the value of loss Milewood may suffer? Can we please exclude data protection claims from this limitation of liability clause if One2Call will be getting access to a lot of personal data, particularly sensitive personal data as a data protection claim made against Milewood could potentially be very high even where One2Call is at fault, but a data subject can claim against either Milewood or One2Call and Milewood would only be able to claim back from One2Call the limitation amount. Clause 26 should be amended as discussed below as currently it places all risk on Milewood.

7.3 and 7.4

These clauses set out circumstances in whicb One2Call will not be liable at all. Again, One2Call has no liability for third party actions. What remedy would Milewood have here if third parties lose data etc?

8.5.4

Milewood can terminate on at least 90 day’s written notice to One2Call if it does not accept any increases made pursuant to clause 6.1 above, however clause 8.2 still seems to apply and Milewood must pay all sums due for the Minimum Period. 

Please can we amend this to:

“By the Client on at least 90 day’s written notice to One2call if it does not accept any increases made pursuant to clause 6.1 above and the Client may terminate before any price increase takes effect and any remaining Charges shall not be payable under clause 8.2”.

11

A clause should be added at clause 11 to state that Milewood shall not be obligated to pay any Charges, Fees or other sums due under the Agreement where a Force Majeure Event occurs. Milewood should not be paying for Services not provided.

13.16.1

13.16 to be removed as clause 2.2 should apply, given (as discussed above in the SLA re clause 15) that Milewood is tied in for the Minimum Period of making payment.

18.3

Clause 18 gives Milewood the right to oppose the proposed appointment of any new subcontractors post the date of the Agreement. It seems like some text is missing from this clause. It does not state what actually happens if Milewood objects.

26 (particularly clauses 26.3 
and 26.4)

This whole section is very onerous  - please can whole of clause 26 be removed and replaced with a standard data processing clause or the clause is removed and the parties enter into a separate standard data processing agreement under which One2Call must take responsibility for its actions as data processor. It cannot put all risk and liability on Milewood.

Master Service Agreement

This sets out as follows:

there s a minimum period of 24 months 
after the 24 month minimum period, the contract continues on a rolling 12 month basis unless terminated by Milewood giving 30 days’ notice on or at any time during the final 30 days of the agreement, Does this mean in the final 30 days of the minimum period and in any renewal term? 

We do not see how this works with clause 8.1 and 8.2 of the General Terms & Conditions (discussed above) which states that the Agreement remains in force until terminated by either party on the provision of not less than ninety (90) days’ notice in writing. If the MSA is terminated on just 30 days’ notice, presumably the agreement and any contracts under it should terminate. I suggest this is clarified.

Under the Heading “Equipment” it states that another set of terms apply at  This page sets out a whole selection of terms and Which actually apply as it may be necessary to review these also. 

It should be noted that Milewood agrees to accept the Microsoft Agreement directly with Microsoft.

It should be noted that Milewood agrees that One2Call may cancel contracts with any current service providers or networks for the telephone numbers listed in the agreement on Milewood’s behalf.
