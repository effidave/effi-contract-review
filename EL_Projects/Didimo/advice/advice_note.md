## Email Body

Hi Anna,

I am very sorry for the delay.

Please see attached for my comments. Given [CUSTOMER]'s negotiating position, I've focused on the issues that present disproportionate risk for a trial of this size. The remaining terms are fairly standard for a large corporate customer and are unlikely to be negotiable.

Things to flag:

*	**AI/machine learning (3.3, Ex. 1)** – please check my proposed wording in Exhibit 1 carefully, especially the statements on training data and use of [CUSTOMER] Data. Please also add details of any third party suppliers you use for this.

*	**Subcontractors/suppliers/service providers (3.4)** – please list these in Exhibit 1 if they will have access to any [CUSTOMER] Data – n.b. this would include cloud service providers who merely host [CUSTOMER] data.

*	**IP in outputs (4)** – please let me know if they are only able to use the outputs during the term of the agreement. At the moment, they own the IP in the outputs. If you only want them to have use during the trial, we should amend this.

*	**Affiliates (3.1)** – are you happy for the entire [CUSTOMER] group to benefit from the trial?

*	**Warranties (9)** – I have added comments on specific warranties. Note in particular the warranty at 9(iv) regarding bias and discrimination in your models/outputs. This is an unusual warranty and may not be covered by your insurance. Please confirm you are comfortable giving this, or let me know if you would like to push back.

*	**Indemnities (10)** – see my comments on the scope. The original draft had unlimited liability under the indemnity, which is disproportionate for a trial of this size.

*	**Data security (8 and Ex. 3)** – I have proposed to limit Exhibit 3 to the following sections which look reasonable and probably align with your existing practices:
    - Section 4 (Basic Security Requirements) – specifically 4.1 (Vulnerability Management) and 4.3 (Access Controls)
    - Section 5 (Data Management and Isolation) – encryption and data classification
    - Section 6 (Data Retention and Destruction)
    - Section 8 (Cyber Security Incidents)
    - Section 9 (Application and Software Requirements)
    
    Please check these look ok – or let me know if you would like me to provide more detail on this.

*	**Liability cap (new clause)** – I have added a general liability cap (12 months' fees) and a supercap of $1m for the indemnity in clause 10 (i.e. IPR, confidentiality, security). This aligns with your insurance limit.

*	**Payment terms (5)** – I have amended from 75 to 45 days, as per your email.

I have availability today if you would like to discuss anything or if you would like me to edit anything.

If you are comfortable with these changes, please delete the internal comments marked "For Didimo". The comments marked "For [CUSTOMER]" are safe for sharing with them.

Thanks,

Dave
