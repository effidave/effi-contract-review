# Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions, together with our engagement letter, form the entire agreement between you ("the Client", "you") and [Consultancy Company Name Ltd] ("the Consultancy", "we", "us").

## 1. Services and Our Obligations

1.1. The specific services to be provided (the "Services") are outlined in our engagement letter. Any additional Services may be agreed in writing. 

1.2. We will perform the Services with reasonable skill and care, consistent with professional standards.

1.3. Our reports and analyses will reflect our independent, objective and impartial opinion.

1.4. Expert Witness Duties: Where any part of the Services includes acting as an expert witness, you acknowledge that our primary and overriding duty is to the court, tribunal, or arbitral panel, as set forth in rules such as Part 35 of the English Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) or other applicable procedural rules. You acknowledge and agree that this duty to the court will always take precedence over any duty to the Client. We will provide our independent and objective opinion.

1.5 We provide economic analysis services. Nothing we provide (orally or in writing) shall be construed as legal advice, financial advice, investment advice, or any recommendation to act or refrain from acting. The Client acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for obtaining appropriate independent legal, financial, tax, or other professional advice in relation to any decisions it may take based on the outputs of the Services.

## 2. Fees and Payment

2.1. Our professional fees are charged based on the time spent by our personnel on your matter. Our standard hourly rates are:
* Director: £400 + VAT (for UK clients) / US$500 (for non-UK clients).

2.3. We will invoice you for our professional fees and for all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the matter (e.g., travel, data acquisition) at cost.

2.4. Invoices will be submitted monthly and are payable within 30 days of the invoice date. All sums are payable without any deduction or set-off.

2.5. All fees are payable regardless of the outcome of the matter in which we are instructed. Any fee estimates we provide are indicative and non-binding.

3.2. This obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that is (a) in the public domain, (b) lawfully received by us from a third party or otherwise already known by us independently of this agreement, (c) required to be disclosed for the purpose of the relevant legal or regulatory proceedings.
