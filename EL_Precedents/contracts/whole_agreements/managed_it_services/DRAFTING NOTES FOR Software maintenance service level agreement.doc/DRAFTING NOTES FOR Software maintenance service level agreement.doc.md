# DRAFTING NOTES FOR Software maintenance: service level agreement

by Practical Law IP&IT

Standard documents | Maintained | United Kingdom

This standard document service level agreement is to be used where the services in question are maintenance and support of specified software. It provides for service credits if actual supplier performance fails to meet the performance standards set in the service levels. It is presented in the form of a schedule, but can be readily adapted to comprise a free-standing agreement if needed.

About this document
 
Service levels and service credits are tools used to ensure that the supplier performs the services to the required standard. They define how well the supplier needs to perform and the immediate financial consequences of failure. Service credits are a mechanism by which amounts are deducted from the amounts to be paid under the contract to the supplier if actual supplier performance fails to meet the performance standards set in the service levels. The main agreement may contain various other mechanisms to rectify poor service delivery. For more information, see . This note analyses how service levels may be set and used and the service credit schemes that may be employed to encourage good performance. The context is outsourcing transactions, but many of the principles referred to in the note are generally applicable.
 
In this standard document, the services in question are maintenance and support of specified on-premises software. It is assumed that, where cloud services are involved, support and maintenance may be conducted centrally by the cloud provider, so some of the provisions of this schedule may not be relevant (for example, it may not be possible to roll back to a previous version or release of the software, see ). For more on cloud support, see .
 
Typically, software support SLAs are only drafted to deal with response and resolve times for operational defects which affect the functions of the software, and do not deal with wider security aspects (such as addressing security vulnerabilities that may be present in software).
 
In light of the increased prevalence, severity, and media scrutiny given to, cybersecurity attacks and the changing regulatory landscape in this area (see  and ) we have included some optional clauses in this standard document to widen the definition of Fault to also cover security vulnerabilities. However, this is approach is largely untested in the legal market and so may be pushed back against by software support vendors who may argue that it would be extremely difficult to set specific service levels relating to security, or may have their own standardised procedures already set up for this. The optional wording is therefore included to ensure that the security aspects of software support are not overlooked, and it may be that the parties will need to build upon these provisions (should it wish to address software security as well as remedying functional defects) to fit with what is technically achievable in practice.
 
Alternatively, the parties may wish to draft and negotiate an entirely separate security level agreement to fit alongside a typical service level agreement for support services, to cover a broader spectrum of cybersecurity risks in addition to software vulnerabilities.
 
 
Supply chain issues: slavery and human trafficking
 
The  (MSA) is aimed at combating crimes of slavery and human trafficking.  of the MSA requires commercial organisations having a global turnover of £36 million or more to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year that ends on or after 31 March 2016. The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business; or state that it has taken no such steps. A customer may want to include wording in its supply agreements that have a connection with a supply chain to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour.
 
For further information on the MSA including links to example clauses, see .
 
Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018
 
The  came into effect on 10 May 2018 pursuant to the Cybersecurity Directive ((EU)2016/1148) (also known as the Network and Information Security or NIS Directive). They have potential impact on any operator of essential services (OES) that relies on IT systems in the following sectors: energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure; and on relevant providers of online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services (Relevant Digital Service Providers (RDSPs)). Like the , the NIS Regulations impose security and incident reporting requirements and provide for high penalties (up to £17 million in the case of the NIS Regulations), but their focus is on security of IT systems, rather than security of the personal data processed by those systems; in practice the two regimes are inextricably linked.
 
For a definition of an OES see , and for a definition of an RDSP see .
 
OESs and RDSPs have obligations to maintain the security of the systems on which their services rely and to report security incidents to their respective regulators (the ICO is the regulator for RDSPs and Schedule 1 of the NIS Regulations lists the regulators for OES). If the customer is an OES or a RDSP, it may require its software support vendors to help it maintain the security of its software, as well as its functional output.

Drafting tips
 
This standard document is presented in the form of a schedule, but can be readily adapted to comprise a free-standing agreement if needed. To do this, follow these steps:
 
delete the schedule heading.
insert provisions for the parties’ details at the beginning and their signatures at the end.
insert appropriate boilerplate provisions from the  (generally, these appear near the beginning and end of the document).
change the references to paragraphs to read clauses.
insert any other appropriate clauses.
  
Drafting for Brexit
 
On 31 January 2020 (), the UK left the EU and the  entered into force. For general information on the withdrawal agreement, , and the operation of UK law following the end of the transition period, see ,  and Practical Law’s .
 
The CJEU continues to have some relevance in UK law on an ongoing basis, although CJEU principles and decisions made since the end of the transition period are not binding on UK courts or tribunals; see .
 
 to  of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA) created a category of law called “retained EU law” at the end of the transition period.  includes EU-derived domestic legislation, some (formerly) directly applicable EU legislation and some other EU rights that were recognised and available in UK law. For more information see 
 
 
Retained EU law
 
The  (REUL Act) makes provision for significant changes to the status, operation and content of retained EU law and most of its provisions come into force at the end of 2023. Retained EU law is known as  for matters arising after the end of 2023, but is referred to in this resource as retained EU law for consistency.
 
The UK government has published a  of retained EU law relating to intellectual property which contains a number of pieces of EU-derived primary and secondary legislation (see ).
 
For more information about retained EU-derived domestic legislation, see .
 
Retained EU case law
 
 is a defined body of case law that is used to interpret retained EU law. Broadly speaking, it consists of the principles laid down by, and any decisions of, the CJEU as they had effect in EU law immediately before the end of the transition period.
 
 of the REUL Act is to come into force on a date specified by commencement regulations, and includes provisions designed to encourage the courts to depart from retained EU case law when interpreting retained EU law. For more information, see .

THE SCHEDULE

SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT

1.  INTERPRETATION

Interpretation
 
The following terms are not defined in the standard document, as they are likely to be defined in the Main Agreement: Bank Holidays, Business Days, Customer Confidential Information, Customer Site, Customer System, Documents, Services, Software, Specification and Term. Insert appropriate definitions if they are not defined there.  states that initial capitalised terms are defined in the Main Agreement.

The following definitions and rules of interpretation apply in this schedule.

1.1  Definitions:

Commercially Reasonable Efforts:  the same degree of priority and diligence with which the Supplier meets the support needs of its other similar customers.

Commercially Reasonable Efforts
 
If acting for the customer, consider replacing each reference to this term to read best endeavours or all reasonable endeavours. Both alternate terms have been judicially interpreted. See .

Contact List:  a current list of Supplier contacts and telephone numbers to enable the Customer to escalate its Support Requests, including:

**a.** the first person to contact; and

**b.** the persons in successively more qualified or experienced positions to provide the support sought.

   Customer Cause:  any of the following causes:

**a.** any improper use, misuse or unauthorised alteration of the Software by the Customer;

**b.** any use of the Software by the Customer in a manner inconsistent with the then-current Documents;

**c.** the use by the Customer of any hardware or software not provided by the Supplier [or approved by the Supplier in the Specification for use by the Customer in connection with the Software]; or

**d.** the use of a non-current version or release of the Software.

   Fault:  any Operational Fault [or Vulnerability].

   Vulnerabilities (optional)
 
We recommended expanding the typical definition of fault here to also cover security vulnerabilities which may be present in software or hardware (and which should also be fixed). See  and .

   Good Industry Practice:  the exercise of that degree of skill, care, prudence, efficiency, foresight and timeliness as would be expected from a [leading] company within the relevant industry or business sector.

   Help Desk Support:  support provided by help desk technicians sufficiently qualified and experienced to identify and resolve most support issues relating to the Software.

   Higher-level Support:  higher-level support provided by an individual on the Contact List.

   [Known Vulnerabilities:  any Vulnerability that has either:

**a.** been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number;

**b.** been disclosed on the National Vulnerability Database available at the website operated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from to time to time; or

**c.** been disclosed on the internet, or any [open] public database, such that it would be revealed by reasonable searches conducted in accordance with Good Industry Practice.]

   Latent Vulnerabilities: any instances of typical classes of Vulnerability. For example, buffer overflows, cross-site scripting (XSS) and Structure Query Language (SQL) injection.

   Known and Latent Vulnerabilities
 
This concept concerns that subset of “known” security vulnerabilities that may be present in software being supported, which the supplier may be expected to mitigate against. A supplier is likely to want to negotiate this definition, reducing its scope to those vulnerabilities disclosed in certain databases only.

   Main Agreement:  the agreement to which this schedule relates.

   Mitigate: the taking of such reasonable steps that would be taken by a prudent supplier in accordance with Good Industry Practice to mitigate against the Vulnerability in question, which may include patching or coding changes, and the terms Mitigated and Mitigation shall be construed accordingly.

   Operational Fault:  failure of the Software to operate in all material respects in accordance with the Specification and Documents, including any operational failure or error referred to in the Service Level Table.

   Out-of-scope Services:  either of the following services:

**a.** any services provided by the Supplier in connection with any apparent problem regarding the Software reasonably determined by the Supplier not to have been caused by a Fault, but rather by a Customer Cause or a cause outside the Supplier’s control (including any investigational work resulting in such a determination); or

**b.** any Higher-level Support provided in the circumstances specified in .

   Service Credits:  the service credits specified in the table set out in .

   Service Levels: the service level responses and response times referred to in the Service Level Table.

   Service Level Table:  the table set out in .

   Solution:  either of the following outcomes:

**a.** correction of an Operational Fault or;

**b.** a workaround in relation to an Operational Fault (including a reversal of any changes to the Software if deemed appropriate by the Supplier) that is reasonably acceptable to the Customer; [or

**c.** Mitigation of a Vulnerability that is reasonably acceptable to the Customer].

   Support Fees:  [DETAILS OF SUPPORT FEES].

   Support Hours:  [Seven days a week, 24 hours a day including Bank Holidays except Christmas Day OR [DETAILS OF SUPPORT HOURS]].

   Support Period:  the Term and, if requested by the Customer, any period during which the Customer transfers the Services to an alternate service provider.

   Support Request:  request made by the Customer in accordance with this schedule for support in relation to the Software, including correction of an Operational Fault.

   Support Services:  maintenance of the then-current version or release of the Software, including Help Desk Support and Higher-level Support, but excluding any Out-of-scope Services.

   Support Services
 
Consider whether this term is intended to extend to enhancements of the Software. If so, amend this definition, for example, by inserting after “Software”: “and any enhancements provided to the Customer during the previous 12-month period (on a rolling basis)”.

   [Vulnerability:   a weakness in the computational logic (for example, code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability, and the term Vulnerabilities shall be construed accordingly.]

   Vulnerability (optional)
 
This concept concerns security vulnerabilities that may be present in software or hardware provided or developed during the project and is based on the definition used by US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

   1.2  All initial capitalised terms in this schedule shall have the meaning given to them in the Main Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein.

   2.  SUPPORT SERVICES

   2.1  During the Support Period the Supplier shall perform the Support Services during the Support Hours in accordance with the Service Levels.

   2.2  As part of the Support Services, the Supplier shall:

   (a)  provide Help Desk Support by means of the following telephone number [TELEPHONE NUMBER] and e-mail address [E-MAIL ADDRESS];

   (b)  commit appropriate resources to the provision of Higher-Level Support;

   Extent of Higher-Level Support
 
If acting for the Customer, also consider whether the Supplier should be more specific about its commitment to provide higher-level technical expertise.

   (c)  where Help Desk Support is not provided within the relevant Service Level response time and the Customer escalates its Support Request to an individual of appropriate qualification or experience on the Contact List, provide Higher-Level Support;

   Contact List
 
Consider whether you wish to be more specific about who the Customer should refer to on the Contact List by reference to particular areas of qualification or experience.

   (d)  use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to:

   (i)  correct all Operational Faults notified under [; and

   (ii)  Mitigate against all Vulnerabilities notified under  or detected under ]

   What level of obligation is reasonable?
 
Consider whether commercially reasonable efforts are sufficient in the circumstances, see .

   (e)  provide technical support for the Software in accordance with the Service Levels.

   (f)  [monitor the Software [on a continuous basis during the Support Hours] for [Known Vulnerabilities or Latent] Vulnerabilities].

   2.3  Any Higher-level Support requested by the Customer to be provided by an individual whose qualification or experience is greater than that reasonably necessary to resolve the relevant Support Request shall be deemed an Out-of-scope Service, provided that an appropriately qualified or experienced individual was available at the time when the Higher-level Support was sought.

   Out-of-scope Higher-level Support
 
This provision is aimed at deterring the Customer from escalating its Support Request inappropriately up the Contact List, that is, to optimise use of a scarce resource.

   2.4  The Supplier may reasonably determine that any services are Out-of-scope Services. If the Supplier makes any such determination, it shall promptly notify the Customer of that determination.

   2.5  The Customer acknowledges that the Supplier is not obliged to provide Out-of-scope Services.

   3.  FEES

   3.1  The provision of Support Services on a remote, off-site basis (such as over the telephone or by e-mail) within the Support Period shall be included in the Support Fees.

   3.2  The provision of Support Services outside the Support Period or at the Customer Site or the provision of Out-of-scope Services shall be charged for at the applicable time and materials rates set out in [DESCRIPTION OF RELEVANT DOCUMENT SETTING OUT RATES].

   4.  SUBMITTING SUPPORT REQUESTS AND ACCESS

   4.1  The Customer may request Support Services by way of a Support Request.

   4.2  Each Support Request shall include a description of the Operational Fault [or Vulnerability] and, where relevant, the start time of the incident.

   4.3  The Customer shall provide the Supplier with:

   (a)  prompt notice of any Faults which it becomes aware of; and

   (b)  such output and other data, documents, information, assistance and (subject to compliance with all Customer’s security and encryption requirements notified to the Supplier in writing) remote access to the Customer System, as are reasonably necessary to assist the Supplier to reproduce operating conditions similar to those present when the Customer detected the relevant Operational Fault and to respond to the relevant Support Request.

   Provision of information by Customer
 
If acting for the Customer, consider adding the following provisions:
 
”The Supplier’s obligation to respond to any Support Request in respect of an Operational Fault shall not be dependent upon the Customer reproducing the problem. However, the parties acknowledge that the time to resolve the Operational Fault may be impacted by the Supplier’s inability to reproduce the Operational Fault.
All such data, documents and information shall constitute Customer Confidential Information under the Main Agreement”.

   4.4  Save for where the Supplier reasonably determines that it requires access to the Customer Site to provide the relevant Support Service, all Support Services shall be provided on an off-site basis (such as over the telephone or by e-mail) from the Supplier’s office.

   4.5  The Customer acknowledges that, to properly assess and resolve Support Requests, it may be necessary to permit the Supplier direct access at the Customer Site to the Customer System and the Customer’s files, equipment and personnel.

   4.6  The Customer shall provide such access promptly, provided that the Supplier complies with all the Customer’s reasonable security requirements and other policies and procedures relating to contractors entering and working on the Customer Site notified to the Supplier in writing reasonably in advance.

   5.  SERVICE LEVELS

   5.1  The Supplier shall:

   (a)  prioritise:

   (i)  all Support Requests based on its reasonable assessment of the severity level of the Fault reported [;

   (ii)  Mitigation of each Vulnerability based on its reasonable assessment of the risk posed by such Vulnerability; and]

   (b)  respond to all Support Requests, [and address all Vulnerabilities] in accordance with the responses and response times specified in the table set out below:

   Severity level of Fault

   Service Level response
 
Both parties should review the text contained in this table and adapt it to their particular circumstances, as these details tend to be highly variable.
 
 
Response times for mitigation of security vulnerabilities (optional)
 
We have expanded the typical service level responses to cover the mitigation of security vulnerabilities, should the parties wish to include this. However, this will likely require adaptation in light of what is technically achievable in practice, see .

   5.2  The parties may, on a case-by-case basis, agree in writing to a reasonable extension of the Service Level response times.

   5.3  The Supplier shall give the Customer regular updates of the nature and status of its efforts to correct [(or, where, relevant, Mitigate)] any Fault [and monthly reports as to achievement of Service Levels and Service Credits to which the Customer has become entitled].

   Updates
 
If acting for the Customer, select the optional text and consider requiring the updates to specify a description of the problem and the estimated time of resolution.

   6.  SERVICE CREDITS

   6.1  If the Supplier fails to provide a Solution within the relevant Service Level response time, the Customer shall become entitled to the Service Credit specified in the table set out below corresponding to the relevant severity level of Fault on submitting a written claim for such Service Credit, provided that the relevant Fault or other problem relating to the Software:

   (a)  did not result from a Customer Cause or a cause outside the Supplier’s control; and

   (b)  [save in the case of Vulnerabilities which should have been detected under ,] was promptly notified to the Supplier under .

   Severity Level of Fault

   Service Credit

   1

   An amount equal to [PERCENTAGE]% of the-then current annual Support Fee for each additional day or part of a day (not to exceed [NUMBER] days) that the Supplier fails to provide a Solution.

   2

   An amount equal to [PERCENTAGE]% of the-then current annual Support Fee for each additional day or part of a day (not to exceed [NUMBER] days) that the Supplier fails to provide a Solution.

   3

   An amount equal to [PERCENTAGE]% of the-then current annual Support Fee for each additional day or part of a day (not to exceed [NUMBER] days) that the Supplier fails to provide a Solution.

   Service Credit amounts
 
In this document the Service Credit amounts are determined by applying a specified percentage figure to the annual support fee and multiplying the result by the number of relevant days. Alternative approaches include specifying a fixed amount and multiplying the result by the number of relevant days.

   6.2  The parties acknowledge that each Service Credit is proportionate when considering the Customer’s legitimate interest to address and resolve all Faults as quickly as possible.

   Service credits
 
When agreeing a service credit regime, the parties should consider the legal implications that arise through use of service credits, including their enforceability. For further discussion on this topic, see .

   6.3  The provision of a Service Credit shall be an exclusive remedy for a particular Service Level failure.

   Exclusive or non-exclusive remedy
 
If acting for the Customer, consider deleting  and adding the following additional remedy:
 
”Without limiting the Supplier’s obligation under paragraph 6.1, if the then-current Software exhibits a severity level 1 or severity level 2 Fault that is unresolved, the Customer may, at its option, use any previous version or release of the Software in which a severity level 1 or severity level 2 Fault does not occur or can be worked around, and the Supplier shall perform all Support Services for such version or release until the Supplier provides a Solution.”
Also consider whether the Service Credits are intended to be the sole remedy for Service Level failures and, if not, consider adding the following provisions:
 
”Even if the Customer becomes entitled to a Service Credit under this schedule, the Customer may obtain such other remedies as may be available to it, either under the Main Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity, including the right to terminate the Main Agreement in accordance with clause [NUMBER]. If the Customer exercises such right then, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that may be available to it, any further Support Fees that fall due during the relevant termination notice period shall remain payable, but the Customer shall cease to be liable for any Support Fees falling due after the notice period has expired. The Supplier shall provide a pro-rata refund of any Support Fees paid in advance.”
Failure to meet the [SERVICE LEVEL TYPE] Service Level [FREQUENCY OF FAILURE IN RELEVANT TIMEFRAME] shall be deemed a [material breach OR breach of a material clause] under clause [NUMBER].”
The aim of the second provision is to facilitate termination by the Customer if the specified Service Levels are not met. Insert the number of the termination clause. The appropriate Service Level should be specified (if there is more than one) and reference to the appropriate clause should be included. If you wish to restrict the operation of this paragraph to multiple failures to meet the relevant service level, you can do so by inserting appropriate text in the second set of square brackets, for example, “twice in any 12-month period”.
 
The parties might seek to achieve a compromise by identifying the particular Service Level failures for which provision of a Service Credit shall or shall not be an exclusive remedy. This may depend, for example, on the severity level of the relevant Fault or other problem relating to the Software.
 
The supplier should be aware that any attempt by it to make service credits an exclusive remedy may be subject to the reasonableness test under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (see, ).

   6.4  Service Credits shall be shown as a deduction from the amount due from the Customer to the Supplier in the next invoice then due to be issued under the Main Agreement. The Supplier shall not in any circumstances be obliged to pay any money or make any refund to the Customer.

   Credit notes and Service Credits cap
 
If acting for the Customer, consider replacing this clause with the following:
 
”The Supplier shall issue a credit note in respect of any Service Credit to which the Customer becomes entitled. The Service Credit shall be repayable by the Supplier as a debt within [NUMBER] Business Days of issue of the credit note.”
If acting for the Supplier, consider capping the total Service Credits to which the Customer may become entitled over, for example, a particular 12-month period.

   7.  OTHER REMEDIES

   7.1  If a Solution is not provided within the relevant Service Level response time, the Customer may escalate the Support Request to the parties’ respective relationship managers identified below and then to their respective senior management identified below:

   [DETAILS OF PARTIES’ RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT]

   8.  COMMUNICATIONS

   8.1  In addition to the mechanisms for giving notice specified in clause [NUMBER] of the Main Agreement, the parties may communicate in respect of any matter referred to in this [schedule OR agreement] by e-mail (unless specified otherwise).
