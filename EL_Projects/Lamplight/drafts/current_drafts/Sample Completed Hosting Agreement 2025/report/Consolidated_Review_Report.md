## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment

The Lamplight Hosting Agreement is a **well-drafted, supplier-protective contract** that is broadly fit for purpose for a low-value B2B SaaS subscription. It contains strong liability protections, comprehensive data protection provisions and sensible operational clauses.

However, when compared against modern market-standard SaaS terms, the agreement has **gaps in commercial protection mechanisms** that may erode Lamplight's position over time—particularly around pricing and exit provisions. Additionally, some drafting conventions (notably the exclusion of email from "writing") are outdated and should be modernised.

**Verdict**: The agreement works well for its current use case. With targeted amendments addressing the priority issues below, it would be a robust template for future customer engagements.

### Key Strengths

- **Strong liability cap** (125% of fees) with appropriate carve-outs
- **Comprehensive data protection clause** (Clause 8) with detailed processor obligations
- **Well-drafted security acknowledgements** that allocate responsibility to customer
- **Detailed technical appendix** (Appendix 3) setting clear backup and DR expectations
- **Acceptance testing clause** (Clause 4) that protects against post-deployment claims
- **UCTA-supportive language** (Clause 10.4) acknowledging customer's ability to negotiate

### Top Recommendations (Prioritised)

|----------|-------|----------------|
| **High** | No price escalation mechanism | Add annual price review clause with 60 days' notice |
| **High** | No data return mechanism | Add time-limited right to request data return, with cost recovery |
| **Medium** | "Writing" excludes email | Amend definition to include email |
| **Medium** | No notices clause | Add formal notices clause with addresses and deemed receipt |
| **Medium** | GDPR references EU law | Update to UK GDPR references post-Brexit |

## 2. Issue-by-Issue Analysis

### A. Commercial Issues

#### 1. Service Specification and Scope

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Service defined in Appendix 2 with functionality list. Application described in Appendix 1. Change control procedure in Clause 6 protects against scope creep. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent uses Order Details and Documentation approach. Equivalent protection. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clauses 2.1, 6; Appendix 1, Appendix 2 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. |

#### 2. Pricing and Payment

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Fixed fee of £35/month in Appendix 1. Payment by direct debit in advance. Provision for increase only if usage exceeds 100 users or 1GB bandwidth. No annual price review mechanism. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent Clause 9.4 allows annual price increases on 60 days' notice. Significantly stronger commercial protection. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 3; Appendix 1 para 11 |
| **Assessment** | **Weak** – no inflation protection |
| **Recommendation** | Add price escalation clause (see Recommended Amendments). |

#### 3. Term and Renewal

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | 3-month initial term with auto-renewal. 30 days' notice to terminate at end of initial term; thereafter 30 days' notice at any time. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent similar structure but termination only at period end, not mid-period. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 13.1; Appendix 1 para 2 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** – short initial commitment, clear renewal mechanism |
| **Recommendation** | Consider whether mid-period termination after initial term is intended. If not, align with precedent. |

---

### B. Risk Allocation Issues

#### 4. Liability Exposure

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Aggregate cap at 125% of fees in preceding 12 months (Clause 10.3). Unlimited liability for death/personal injury and tangible property damage (£20,000). Indirect/consequential loss excluded (Clause 10.1). |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent caps at 100% of fees. Lamplight marginally more generous but still protective. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 10 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. 125% cap may assist UCTA reasonableness argument. |

#### 5. Indemnities

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Mutual IP indemnities (Clauses 11, 12). Supplier indemnifies for Application IP infringement; customer indemnifies for Customer Data IP issues. Standard carve-outs. Clause 11.3 states "entire liability" but could be clearer. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent has broader customer indemnity (all use-related claims) and express "sole and exclusive remedy" language. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clauses 11, 12 |
| **Assessment** | **Adequate** |
| **Recommendation** | Consider broadening customer indemnity and adding express "sole and exclusive remedy" wording. |

#### 6. Warranties

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Lamplight warrants services performed with due care and skill (Clause 9.1). Exclusive remedy is correction, replacement or refund (Clause 9.2). 3-month claim window (Clause 9.3). Implied warranties excluded (Clause 9.5). |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Equivalent approach. Lamplight's time-limited warranty claim is supplier-protective. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 9 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. |

#### 7. Insurance

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | No insurance requirements. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent also silent on insurance. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | None |
| **Assessment** | **N/A** – appropriate for contract value |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. Consider adding for higher-value contracts. |

---

### C. Intellectual Property Issues

#### 8. IP Ownership

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Lamplight retains IP in Application (Clause 5.1). Customer retains IP in Customer Data. Customer grants limited licence to Lamplight for performance. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent additionally addresses Improvements (Clauses 10.2-10.3), with express assignment to supplier. Lamplight's agreement silent on improvements. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 5.1 |
| **Assessment** | **Adequate** – but gap on improvements |
| **Recommendation** | Consider adding clause confirming Lamplight owns all improvements/enhancements. |

#### 9. Licence Scope

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Licence to use Application as part of Service only (Clause 2.1.2). Customer may only use for own data/internal purposes (Clause 2.2.4). No express reverse engineering or competitive use prohibition. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent has detailed restrictions (Clause 2.5): no reverse engineering, no competitive use, no sublicensing, no virus introduction. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 2.1.2, 2.2.4-2.2.5 |
| **Assessment** | **Weak** – missing standard restrictions |
| **Recommendation** | Add licence restrictions clause (see Recommended Amendments). |

#### 10. Customer Data

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Customer owns Customer Data (Clause 5.1). No express data export right on termination. Appendix 4 addresses deletion (28 days post-termination) but not return. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent Clause 14.3(c) gives time-limited right to request return (10 days), delivery within 30 days, subject to fee payment, customer pays extraction costs. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 5.1; Appendix 4 para 3 |
| **Assessment** | **Weak** – no data return mechanism |
| **Recommendation** | Add data return clause with time limit and cost recovery (see Recommended Amendments). |

---

### D. Data and Security Issues

#### 11. Data Protection

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Comprehensive Clause 8 covering controller/processor roles, Article 28 requirements, security measures, breach notification (24 hours), sub-processor consent, international transfers, data subject requests. Data Protocol in Appendix 4. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Both comprehensive. Lamplight's 24-hour breach notification stricter than precedent's "without undue delay". Lamplight references EU GDPR; should update to UK GDPR. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 8; Appendix 4 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** – but needs UK GDPR update |
| **Recommendation** | Update GDPR references from EU to UK GDPR (see Recommended Amendments). |

#### 12. Security Obligations

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Clause 8.5.1 requires appropriate technical and organisational measures. Clause 8.6-8.7 contain detailed acknowledgements limiting Lamplight's security obligations. Appendix 3 sets out AWS infrastructure and backup procedures. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent has heightened cybersecurity disclaimer (Clause 7.3(a)(iv)). Lamplight's acknowledgements are more detailed and supplier-protective. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 8.5-8.7; Appendix 3 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. Clauses 8.6-8.7 are a strength. |

#### 13. Confidentiality

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Mutual confidentiality (Clause 7). Customer Data included. Standard permitted disclosures. Survives termination indefinitely. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent specifies 5-year survival period (Clause 11.8). Lamplight's indefinite survival is arguably stronger but less predictable. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 7 |
| **Assessment** | **Adequate** |
| **Recommendation** | Consider adding defined survival period for certainty (optional). |

---

### E. Operational Issues

#### 14. Service Levels

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | No SLAs. Appendix 3 describes infrastructure and monitoring but makes no binding commitments. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent also silent on SLAs (defers to Support Policy). |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Appendix 3 |
| **Assessment** | **Adequate** – appropriate for price point |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. Absence of SLAs is intentional and supplier-protective. |

#### 15. Support and Maintenance

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | General support described in Clause 2.1.4 and Appendix 2. Optional paid support packs. Training options detailed. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent defers to Support Policy with amendment rights. Similar approach. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 2.1.4; Appendix 2 |
| **Assessment** | **Adequate** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. |

#### 16. Change Management

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Formal change control procedure (Clause 6). Lamplight may replace Third Party Applications/Service Provider with notice; customer has termination right if dissatisfied (Clauses 5.3-5.4). Upgrades permitted with reasonable endeavours to minimise disruption (Clause 5.5). |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent simpler: supplier may update provided no material reduction in functionality. Lamplight's 30-day customer termination right is more generous than precedent. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clauses 5.3-5.5, 6 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** – comprehensive change management |
| **Recommendation** | Consider whether customer termination right for service provider changes is too generous. Could reduce notice period. |

---

### F. Exit and Dispute Issues

#### 17. Termination Rights

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Either party: 30 days' notice at/after initial term (Clause 13.1). Immediate termination for material breach (30-day cure), insolvency (Clause 13.2). Lamplight can terminate if customer discontinues use (Clause 13.3). |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Equivalent approach. Lamplight's discontinuation trigger is an additional protection. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 13 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. |

#### 18. Exit Provisions

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Clause 13.5 confirms survival of Clauses 7 and 8. Appendix 4 para 3 addresses deletion of data 28 days post-termination. No express data return right. No transition assistance. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent Clause 14.3(c) has time-limited data return mechanism with cost recovery. More structured exit. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 13.5; Appendix 4 para 3 |
| **Assessment** | **Weak** – gap on data return |
| **Recommendation** | Add data return mechanism (see Recommended Amendments). |

#### 19. Dispute Resolution

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | English law (Clause 15.1). Tiered dispute resolution: senior management (14 days), expert determination for technical disputes, High Court for others (Clause 15.2). |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent has English law and exclusive jurisdiction only. Lamplight's expert determination is an additional feature. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 15 |
| **Assessment** | **Strong** |
| **Recommendation** | No change required. Expert determination could be retained or removed. |

---

### G. Structural Issues

#### 20. Boilerplate Adequacy

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Force majeure (mutual), assignment (customer needs consent, silent on supplier), severability, waiver, third party rights exclusion, entire agreement. "Writing" excludes email (Clause 1.7). No notices clause. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Precedent includes: express email in writing, formal notices clause, express supplier assignment right, standalone variation clause. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clauses 1.7, 14.1-14.6 |
| **Assessment** | **Weak** – outdated drafting conventions, missing notices clause |
| **Recommendation** | Modernise "writing" definition, add notices clause, add supplier assignment right (see Recommended Amendments). |

---

### H. Other Issues

#### Acceptance Testing

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Clause 4 deems services accepted if customer uses in live environment without testing or without reporting errors. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Not in precedent. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 4 |
| **Assessment** | **Good addition** – supplier-protective |
| **Recommendation** | Retain. |

#### Negotiation Acknowledgement

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Current State** | Clause 10.4 acknowledges customer could have negotiated different liability limits. |
| **Precedent Comparison** | Not in precedent. |
| **Relevant Clauses** | Clause 10.4 |
| **Assessment** | **Good addition** – supports UCTA reasonableness |
| **Recommendation** | Retain. |

---

## 3. Recommended Amendments

### High Priority

#### A1. Add Price Escalation Clause

**Risk if not addressed**: Revenue erosion over multi-year relationships; no inflation protection.

**Suggested drafting** (new Clause 3.4):

> *"3.4 Lamplight may increase the Fees on each anniversary of the Commencement Date upon giving the Customer not less than 60 days' prior written notice. Any such increase shall take effect from the relevant anniversary date and the Fees set out in Appendix 1 shall be deemed amended accordingly."*

**Placement**: After Clause 3.3.

---

#### A2. Add Data Return Mechanism

**Risk if not addressed**: Customer could demand data return at any time post-termination with no cost recovery; creates operational uncertainty.

**Suggested drafting** (new Clause 13.6):

> *"13.6 Following termination or expiry of this Agreement, the Customer may request return of the Customer Data by written notice to Lamplight within 14 days of the effective date of termination. Subject to payment of all outstanding Fees and Lamplight's reasonable costs of extraction and delivery, Lamplight shall deliver the Customer Data in a standard format within 30 days of receipt of such request. If no such request is received within 14 days of termination, Lamplight may delete the Customer Data in accordance with Appendix 4."*

**Placement**: After Clause 13.5.

---

### Medium Priority

#### A3. Amend "Writing" Definition to Include Email

**Suggested amendment** to Clause 1.7:

> *"A reference to writing or written includes email."*

*(Delete reference to faxes unless specifically required.)*

---

#### A4. Add Notices Clause

**Risk if not addressed**: No certainty about when formal notices take effect; potential disputes about service.

**Suggested drafting** (new Clause 14.7):

> *"14.7 Notices*
>
> *14.7.1 Any notice required to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand, sent by pre-paid first-class post or recorded delivery, or sent by email, to the other party at its address or email address set out in Appendix 1, or such other address as may have been notified in writing.*
>
> *14.7.2 A notice delivered by hand shall be deemed received when delivered. A notice sent by pre-paid first-class post or recorded delivery shall be deemed received 2 Business Days after posting. A notice sent by email shall be deemed received at the time of transmission, provided no delivery failure notification is received.*
>
> *14.7.3 This clause does not apply to the service of proceedings."*

**Additional change**: Add notice addresses to Appendix 1.

---

#### A5. Update GDPR References to UK GDPR

**Risk if not addressed**: References to EU GDPR and EEA are technically inaccurate for UK law post-Brexit; could create ambiguity.

**Suggested amendments**:

1. Clause 1.1.5: Replace definition to reference UK GDPR (as defined in DPA 2018)
2. Clause 1.1.8: Delete or update EU GDPR definition
3. Clause 8.5.3: Replace "European Economic Area" with "United Kingdom"
4. Clause 8.9: Replace "EEA" with "UK" throughout

---

#### A6. Add Licence Restrictions

**Risk if not addressed**: No express prohibition on reverse engineering or competitive use of the service.

**Suggested drafting** (new Clause 2.2.6):

>
> *(b) access or use the Service for the purpose of building a product or service which competes with the Service;*
>
> *(c) introduce, or permit the introduction of, any virus, malware or other malicious code into the Service or Lamplight's systems; or*
>
> *(d) sublicense, sell, rent, lease or otherwise make the Service available to any third party other than the Permitted Users."*

---

#### A7. Add Express Supplier Assignment Right

**Risk if not addressed**: No express right for Lamplight to assign the agreement, which could impede business sale or restructuring.

**Suggested drafting** (new Clause 14.2A):

> *"14.2A Lamplight may assign, transfer, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the Customer's consent."*

**Placement**: After Clause 14.2.

---

### Nice-to-Have

#### A8. Clarify IP Indemnity as Sole Remedy

**Suggested amendment** to Clause 11.3:

> *"This Clause 11 states the Customer's sole and exclusive rights and remedies, and Lamplight's entire obligations and liability, for infringement or alleged infringement of any third party Intellectual Property Rights."*

---

#### A9. Add Improvements Ownership Clause

**Suggested drafting** (new Clause 5.1A):

> *"5.1A Any improvement, enhancement or modification to the Application or Service developed by Lamplight during the term of this Agreement shall be owned by Lamplight, and the Customer shall have no rights therein except as expressly granted under this Agreement."*

---

#### A10. Add Confidentiality Survival Period

**Suggested amendment** to Clause 7.1:

> *"...The foregoing obligations as to confidentiality shall remain in full force and effect for a period of five years from termination or expiry of this Agreement."*

---

## 4. Summary

The Lamplight Hosting Agreement is a competent, supplier-protective contract that handles most legal issues appropriately for its purpose. The recommended amendments focus on:

1. **Commercial protection** – ensuring pricing can keep pace with costs
2. **Exit clarity** – providing a structured data return process
3. **Modern drafting** – updating communication methods and regulatory references
4. **Standard protections** – adding licence restrictions common in SaaS agreements

Implementation of the High and Medium priority amendments would bring the agreement in line with current market practice while preserving its supplier-friendly character.
