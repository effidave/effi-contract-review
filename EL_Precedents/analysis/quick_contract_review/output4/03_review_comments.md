> For Didimo: For a trial licence I normally remove warranties and indemnities and fall back to “as is”.  This largely depends on whether you are being paid / how much you are being paid.  From your email, I infer that you are prepared to accept some liability.

**Referenced text:** "Specifications.  Vendor will use reasonable efforts to cause the Vendor IP to perform or otherwise comply in all material respects in accordance with any specifications related to the Vendor IP provided to Company or otherwise made publicly available."
