 847 applications per month
  and inclusively 
 supports up to 
 1,000 applications per month
  without additional cost.
+The Subscription Fee shall be chargeable from the Effective Date of this SOW. The monthly usage estimate of 1,000 applications is indicative; any usage in excess of this estimate shall require the parties' prior written agreement on additional fees. Third-party service costs (including but not limited to Veriff, Creditsafe and DocuSign per-transaction fees) shall be borne by Elavon and, where applicable, treated as Pass-Through Expenses.
 Threshold for Negotiations
 : The parties agree that if the usage of the services provided under this Agreement exceeds one thousand (1,000) applications per month, new commercial negotiations will be initiated.
 Negotiation Process
 : Upon reaching this threshold, the parties will engage in good faith negotiations to agree on revised commercial terms that reflect the increased usage. These negotiations will commence within thirty (30) days of the Supplier notifying the Client that the threshold has been exceeded.
 Usage and Add-Ons:
  Overage charges and optional services are detailed in Appendix C.
+Overage charges shall only apply where Elavon's usage exceeds the agreed monthly application limit. Prior to incurring overage charges, Wiseflow shall notify Elavon and the parties shall agree in writing to the applicable overage rate.
 Usage Notification
 : The Supplier agrees to monitor the usage of the services provided under this Agreement. If the usage reaches seventy-five percent (75%) of the allowed limit, the Supplier shall promptly inform the Client in writing.
 No Exceeding Invoicing
 : The Supplier agrees not to exceed the invoiced amount without obtaining prior written approval from the Client. Any additional charges or overages must be pre-approved in writing by the Client before invoicing.
   This shall take priority over the process in the MSA.
