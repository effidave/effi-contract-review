## 1. Spelling Conventions

### 1.1 -ise vs -ize Endings
Use **-ise** endings (not American -ize):
- CORRECT: organise, recognise, authorise, minimise, realise, utilise

## 2. Legal Terminology

### 2.1 British Legal Terms
Use British legal terminology, not American equivalents:

| British (CORRECT) | American (INCORRECT) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| solicitor, barrister | attorney, lawyer |
| claimant | plaintiff |
| High Court | trial court |
| covenant | (often) promise |
| freehold, leasehold | fee simple |
| indemnity | hold harmless (when used as noun) |
| schedule (to a contract) | exhibit |
| execution (of document) | signing |
| undertaking | commitment |
| deed | (sometimes) instrument |

### 2.2 Legislation References
Use correct UK citation format:
- CORRECT: "the Companies Act 2006" (not "of 2006")
- CORRECT: "section 123" or "s.123" (not "Section" with capital S in running text)
- CORRECT: "paragraph (a)" or "sub-section (2)"
- CORRECT: "Schedule 1, Part 2, paragraph 3"

## 3. Punctuation and Formatting

### 3.1 Date Format
Use **day-month-year** format:
- CORRECT: 9 December 2025, 9th December 2025, 09/12/2025
- INCORRECT: December 9, 2025 (American)
- INCORRECT: 12/09/2025 (ambiguous)

In formal contracts, spell out the month:
- CORRECT: "dated the 9th day of December 2025"
- CORRECT: "dated 9 December 2025"

### 3.2 Time Format
Use 24-hour clock or explicit am/pm:
- CORRECT: 14:30, 2:30 pm, 2.30 pm
- Avoid ambiguity: specify time zone if relevant (GMT, BST)

### 3.3 Numbers
- Spell out numbers one to ten; use figures for 11+
- Always use figures for: dates, money, percentages and clause references
- Use commas for thousands: 1,000 / 1,000,000
- Currency: £1,000 (not GBP 1,000 in running text)

### 3.4 Full Stops in Abbreviations
Omit full stops in abbreviations:
- CORRECT: Mr, Mrs, Dr, Ltd, plc, UK, VAT
- INCORRECT: Mr., Mrs., Dr., Ltd., U.K.

### 3.5 Commas
Do not use the Oxford (serial) comma before "and" or "or" in lists:
- CORRECT: "The agreement covers licensing, support and maintenance."
- INCORRECT: "The agreement covers licensing, support, and maintenance."

Use commas to separate:
- Introductory phrases: "Subject to clause 5, the Supplier must..."
- Non-restrictive clauses: "The Agreement, which was signed on 1 January, provides..."
- Parenthetical elements: "The parties, ABC Limited and XYZ Limited, agree..."

Omit commas where they create ambiguity in legal drafting. When in doubt, restructure the sentence for clarity.

### 3.6 Dashes
Use hyphens (-) for compound words and ranges. Do not use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–):
- CORRECT: "a five-year term", "clauses 1-5", "the Supplier - as defined below - must..."
- INCORRECT: "the Supplier—as defined below—must..." (em dash)
- INCORRECT: "the Supplier – as defined below – must..." (en dash)

For parenthetical insertions, prefer commas or brackets over dashes.

## 4. Grammar and Syntax

### 4.1 Collective Nouns
British English treats collective nouns as **plural** when emphasising individual members:
- CORRECT: "The Board have decided..." (members acting individually)
- CORRECT: "The Board has decided..." (acting as single entity)
- CORRECT: "The Government are proposing..." (common in UK)

For companies, either is acceptable but be consistent within a document.

### 4.2 "Which" vs "That"
British English is more flexible, but for legal clarity:
- Use **that** for restrictive clauses (essential information)
- Use **which** (with comma) for non-restrictive clauses (additional information)
- CORRECT: "The documents that are marked confidential..." (only those marked)
- CORRECT: "The documents, which are marked confidential,..." (all documents, which happen to be marked)

### 4.3 "Shall" vs "Will" vs "Must"
Modern legal drafting preference:
- **Must** for obligations: "The Supplier must deliver..."
- **Will** for future facts: "The Agreement will terminate..."
- **Shall** is traditional but increasingly replaced by "must" for clarity
- Be consistent throughout the document

### 4.4 Subjunctive Mood
British English retains subjunctive in formal/legal writing:
- CORRECT: "The Court requires that the Defendant be present"
- CORRECT: "It is essential that the notice be given in writing"

## 5. Contract Drafting Conventions

### 5.1 Defined Terms
- Use initial capitals for defined terms: "Confidential Information", "the Agreement", "the Parties"
- Define terms on first use or in a Definitions section
- Use consistent formatting throughout

### 5.2 Party References
- Define parties in the recitals: "ABC Limited (the 'Supplier')"
- Use defined short form thereafter, not full company name
- "Party" (capitalised) when referring to contract parties

### 5.3 Clause Structure
Use numbered hierarchical structure:
- 1. (main clause)
- 1.1 (sub-clause)
- 1.1(a) (paragraph within sub-clause)
- 1.1(a)(i) (sub-paragraph)

### 5.4 Schedules and Attachments
- Use "Schedule" not "Exhibit" (British convention)
- Reference as: "Schedule 1 (Specifications)"
- Schedules form part of the agreement: "The Schedules form part of this Agreement"

### 5.5 Execution Blocks
For English law contracts (not executed as a deed):
- Companies: "Signed for and on behalf of [COMPANY] by:" followed by signature line, printed name and title/position
- Individuals: "Signed by [NAME]:" followed by signature line

For deeds, additional formalities apply (witness requirements, specific wording).

## 6. Common Errors to Avoid

### 6.1 Latin Phrases
Use sparingly and correctly:
- CORRECT: inter alia (among other things)
- CORRECT: bona fide (in good faith)
- CORRECT: per annum (per year)
- CORRECT: mutatis mutandis (with necessary changes)
- Italicise Latin phrases in formal documents

### 6.2 Misused Legal Terms
- **Indemnify** vs **guarantee**: Indemnity is primary obligation; guarantee is secondary
- **Warranty** vs **condition**: Breach of condition allows termination; breach of warranty allows damages only
- **Terminate** vs **rescind**: Termination ends future obligations; rescission unwinds ab initio

### 6.3 Gender-Neutral Language
Use gender-neutral drafting:
- CORRECT: "they/their" as singular pronoun
- CORRECT: "the Customer", "the individual", "the party"
- INCORRECT: "he/she", "s/he", "he or she" (outdated)
- INCORRECT: Generic "he" (outdated)

### 6.4 Plain English
Prefer modern plain English where possible:
- CORRECT: "before" not "prior to"
- CORRECT: "after" not "subsequent to"  
- CORRECT: "about" not "with respect to" / "in relation to"
- CORRECT: "if" not "in the event that"
- CORRECT: "under" not "pursuant to" (in most contexts)

But retain precision where needed - legal terms of art serve a purpose.
