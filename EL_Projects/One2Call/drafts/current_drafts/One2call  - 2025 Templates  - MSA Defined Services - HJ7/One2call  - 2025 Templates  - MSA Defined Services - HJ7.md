            **(a)** the Quotation;

            **(b)** the Agreement Details;

            **(c)** if there is no Quotation, the specification of Goods and/or Services described in the Order Request;

            **(d)** any Service Schedules which are relevant to the Order; and

         **3.2** If there is a conflict between any of the provisions of any document listed in clause 3.1, the conflict will be resolved in favour of the document appearing higher (i.e. earlier) in the list.

         **3.3** Any samples, drawings, descriptive matter or advertising issued by the Supplier and any descriptions of the Goods or illustrations or descriptions of the Services contained in the Supplier's catalogues or brochures are issued or published for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Goods and Services described in them. They shall not form part of the Order nor have any contractual force.

         **3.4** These One2Call Terms and Conditions apply to the Order to the exclusion of any other terms that the Customer seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by law, trade custom, practice or course of dealing.  The Customer waives any right it might otherwise have to rely on any term endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in any documents of the Customer that is inconsistent with these One2Call Terms and Conditions.

         **5.4** The Supplier shall not be liable to the Customer for any loss or damage whether arising directly or indirectly from the late delivery or short delivery of the Goods. If short delivery does take place, the Customer undertakes not to reject the Goods but to accept the Goods delivered as part performance of the Order.

         **5.5** The Customer shall make all arrangements necessary to take delivery of the Goods on the day notified by the Supplier for delivery.

         **5.6** If the Customer fails to take delivery of the Goods within five Business Days of the Supplier notifying the Customer that the Goods are ready for delivery, then the Supplier shall be entitled to store the Goods until actual delivery takes place, and charge the Customer for all related costs and expenses (including insurance).

         **5.7** Delivery of the Goods shall be completed on the completion of unloading of the Goods at the Delivery Location.

         **5.8** Any dates quoted for delivery of the Goods are approximate only, and the time of delivery is not of the essence. The Supplier shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of the Goods that is caused by a Force Majeure Event or the Customer's failure to provide the Supplier with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Goods.

         **5.9** If the Supplier fails to deliver the Goods, its liability shall be limited to the costs and expenses incurred by the Customer in obtaining replacement goods of similar description and quality in the cheapest market available, less the price of the Goods.

         **5.10** The Supplier may deliver the Goods by instalments, which shall be invoiced and paid for separately. Each instalment shall constitute a separate contract. Any delay in delivery or defect in an instalment shall not entitle the Customer to cancel any other instalment.

      **6.** Acceptance of Goods

         **6.1** The Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Goods 48 hours after delivery to the Customer.

         **6.2** The Customer shall carry out a thorough inspection of the Goods within 48 hours of delivery and shall give written notification to the Supplier within 5 working days of delivery of the Goods of any defects which a reasonable examination would have revealed.

         **6.3** Where the Customer has accepted, or has been deemed to have accepted, the Goods the Customer shall not be entitled to reject Goods which are not in accordance with the Order.

      **7.** Quality of Goods

         **7.1** The Supplier warrants that the Goods will at the time of delivery correspond to the Goods Specification.

         **7.3** The Supplier shall not be liable for the Goods' failure to comply with the warranty set out in clause 7.1 if:

            **(d)** the Customer alters or repairs such Goods without the written consent of the Supplier;

         **7.4** Except as provided in this clause 7, the Supplier shall have no liability to the Customer in respect of the Goods' failure to comply with the warranty set out in clause 7.1.

               **(ii)** the ongoing financial position of the Customer.

         **8.4** Subject to clause 8.5, the Customer may use the Goods in the ordinary course of its business (but not otherwise) before the Supplier receives payment for the Goods.

         **14.5** Ad hoc Services.  The Customer shall pay the Supplier for any ad hoc or additional work not covered by the Order, provided that such work has been agreed in writing by the parties in advance.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer shall not be liable for any charges not expressly agreed in writing or set out in the Order.

         **14.6** Cancellation charges.

            **(a)** increase the price for the Goods and/or charges for the Services by giving the Customer at least 30 days’ written notice, to reflect any increase in the cost of the Goods and/or Services to the Supplier that is due to:

The Customer shall ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet each payment.

         **14.13** VAT. All amounts payable by the Customer under the Order are exclusive of amounts in respect of value added tax chargeable from time to time (VAT). Where any taxable supply for VAT purposes is made under the Order by the Supplier to the Customer, the Customer shall, on receipt of a valid VAT invoice from the Supplier, pay to the Supplier such additional amounts in respect of VAT as are chargeable on the supply of the Services or Goods or both, as applicable, at the same time as payment is due for the supply of the Services or Goods.

         **14.14** Interest  If the Customer fails to make a payment due to the Supplier under the Order by the due date, then, without limiting the Supplier's remedies under clause 20, the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue sum from the due date until payment of the overdue sum, whether before or after judgment. Interest under this clause 14.14 will accrue each day at 8% a year above the Bank of England's base rate from time to time, but at 8% a year for any period when that base rate is below 0%.

      **15.** Changes to Services

         **15.1** The Customer may request changes to the scope or nature of the Services. The Supplier shall respond within a reasonable time and may propose revised Charges or timelines. Changes shall not be effective unless agreed in writing.

            **(c)** the Customer's use of the Services or Deliverables after notice of the alleged or actual infringement from the Supplier or any appropriate authority; or

            **(d)** the Customer Materials or Customer Systems; or

            **(a)** was known to the recipient before its receipt from the disclosing party;

         **24.4** Waiver.

            **(a)** A waiver of any right or remedy under the Agreement or any Order(s) or by law is only effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent right or remedy.

            **(b)** A failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under the Agreement or any Order(s) or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

         **24.5** No partnership or agency. Nothing in the Agreement or any Order(s) is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership or joint venture between the parties, constitute either party the agent of the other, or authorise either party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the other party.

         **24.6** Entire agreement.

         Purpose: means the purposes for which the Customer Personal Data is processed, as set out in paragraph 7.1 of this DPA.

         UK GDPR: has the meaning given to it in the Data Protection Act 2018.

         **7.1** appoint processors to process the Customer Personal Data, provided that the Supplier:

            **(a)** shall ensure that the terms on which it appoints such processors comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws, and are consistent with the obligations imposed on the Supplier in this DPA;

The current list of processors appointed by the Supplier is included in Annex 2.

         **7.2** transfer Customer Personal Data outside of the UK and EEA as required for the Purpose, provided that the Supplier shall ensure that all such transfers are made in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.
