The Licensor shall provide reasonable assistance, at the Licensee's cost, to enable the Licensee to comply with clause 9.1.
Royalty
[On the Effective Date the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor the sum of £[AMOUNT] [and such sum shall not be returnable nor available for credit against royalties or any other sums payable by the Licensee under this agreement OR as an advance against royalties payable under clause 10.2].]
The Licensee shall pay to the Licensor a royalty of [PERCENTAGE]% of the Net Sales Price of each Licensed Product that is in the Territory:
sold by the Licensee;
lent, leased, let on hire or sold on hire purchase by the Licensee;
supplied by the Licensee to any person otherwise than in clause 10.2(a) or clause 10.2(b); or
put into use by the Licensee,
provided always that, in respect of any Licensed Product manufactured, used or supplied, only a single royalty shall be payable, and the royalty accrues on the date when the Licensed Product is used or supplied, the date it is supplied being the earliest of when it is invoiced, paid for, installed or delivered. 
[If the payment calculated in accordance with clause 10.2 in respect of any Quarterly Period is less than the Minimum Royalty for that Quarterly Period then the Licensee shall, in addition, make such further payment as shall make the payment so calculated up to the Minimum Royalty.]
Royalties shall be payable under this agreement even if some part of the manufacture, supply or putting into use of the Licensed Products by the Licensee takes place in a part of the Territory where there is no Patent or where the Licensed Product does not fall within the scope of any Patent.
Royalties and other sums payable under this agreement are exclusive of VAT (or similar tax) and shall be paid free and clear of all deductions and withholdings whatsoever, unless the deduction or withholding is required by law. If any deduction or withholding is required by law the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor such sum as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Licensor with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding. If the Licensee is required by law to make a deduction or withholding, the Licensee shall, within five Business Days of making the deduction or withholding, provide a statement in writing showing the gross amount of the payment, the amount of the sum deducted and the actual amount paid.
Royalties and any other sums payable under this agreement shall be paid in sterling to the credit of a bank account to be designated in writing by the Licensor. 
Royalties payable under this agreement shall be paid within 30 days of the end of each successive Quarterly Period [and for the purpose of converting the local currency of the Licensee (in which such royalties arise) into sterling, the rate of exchange to be applied shall be the rate of exchange applied by the [London] bankers to the Licensor for the purchase of sterling with such foreign currency as at the close of business on the date when the relevant payment first becomes due].
In the event of any delay in paying any sum due under this agreement by the due date, the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor:
interest (calculated on a daily basis) on the overdue payment from the date when such payment was due to the date of actual payment at a rate of [PERCENTAGE]% over the base rate of [FULL NAME OF BANK] from time to time; and
an amount equal to any penalties incurred by the Licensor as a direct result of the delay.
At the same time as payment of royalties falls due, the Licensee shall submit or cause to be submitted to the Licensor a statement in writing recording the calculation of such royalties payable and in particular:
the Quarterly Period for which the royalties were calculated;
the number of Licensed Products supplied or used during the Quarterly Period;
the number of Licensed Products manufactured during the Quarterly Period but not yet supplied;
the Net Sales Price of each Licensed Product supplied or used during the Quarterly Period;
the amount of royalties due and payable;
the amount of any withholding or other income taxes deductible or due to be deducted from the amount of royalties due and payable; and
any other particulars the Licensor may reasonably require.
The Licensee shall keep proper records and books of account showing the description and price of Licensed Products supplied or put into use. Such records and books shall be kept separate from any records and books not relating solely to the Licensed Products and be open during normal business hours to inspection and audit by the Licensor (or its authorised representative), who shall be entitled to take copies of or extracts from them. If such inspection or audit should reveal a discrepancy in the royalties paid from those payable under this agreement, the Licensee shall immediately make up the shortfall and reimburse the Licensor in respect of any professional charges incurred for such audit or inspection. Such right of inspection of the Licensor shall remain in effect for a period of [one] year[s] after the termination of this agreement.
[If the Licensee is prohibited by a governmental authority in any country from making any payment due under this agreement then the Licensee shall, within the prescribed period for making such payment, use its best endeavours to secure from such authority permission to make such payment and shall make it within [seven] days of receiving such permission. If such permission is not received within [30] days of the Licensee making a request for such permission then, at the option of the Licensor, the Licensee shall either deposit the payment in the currency of the relevant country in a bank account designated by the Licensor within such country, or make the payment to a Group Company of the Licensor designated by the Licensor and having an office in the relevant country or in another country designated by the Licensor.]
Within [30] days of the end of each calendar year, the Licensee shall submit to the Licensor a written statement certified by the Licensee's auditors of the aggregate Net Sales Price of Licensed Products supplied or put into use by the Licensee in that year and the amount due to be paid for that year under this clause 10 (Royalty). If such statement shows that the amount paid by the Licensee is less than the amount due, the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor within [seven] days of the submission of the statement an amount equivalent to the difference between the amount paid and the amount due.
The provisions of this clause 10 (Royalty) shall remain in effect notwithstanding termination or expiry of this agreement until the settlement of all subsisting claims by the Licensor.
[Where the Licensee has granted any sub-licence pursuant to clause 14 ,(Sub-licensing) the Licensee shall include, in its royalty payments, payments in respect of all activities set out in clause 10.2 which are carried out by or on behalf of the sub-licensee, and shall include records of such activities in the statements it submits pursuant to clause 10.5, clause 10.9 and clause 10.12.]
Protection of the Patents [and Licensed Know-how]
The Licensee shall immediately notify the Licensor in writing, giving full particulars, if any of the following matters come to its attention:
any actual, suspected or threatened infringement of any of the Patents;
[any actual, suspected or threatened unauthorised disclosure, misappropriation or misuse of the Licensed Know-how;]
any actual or threatened claim that any of Patents is invalid;
any actual or threatened opposition to any of the Patents;
any claim made or threatened that exploitation of any of the Patents [or the Licensed Know-how] infringes the rights of any third party;
any person applies for, or is granted, a patent by reason of which that person may be, or has been, granted, rights which conflict with any of the rights granted to the Licensee under this agreement;
any application is made for a compulsory licence under any Patent; or 
any other form of attack, charge or claim to which the Patents [or Licensed Know-how] may be subject.
In respect of any of the matters listed in clause 11.1:
the Licensor shall, in its absolute discretion, decide what action, if any, to take;
the Licensor shall have exclusive control over, and conduct of, all claims and proceedings;
the Licensee shall not make any admissions other than to the Licensor and shall provide the Licensor with all assistance that it may reasonably require in the conduct of any claims or proceedings; and
the Licensor shall bear the cost of any proceedings and shall be entitled to retain all sums recovered in any action for its own account.
The Licensee shall not institute proceedings, except as allowed by this agreement or expressly authorised by the Licensor and the provisions of section 67(1) of the Patents Act 1977 (or equivalent legislation in any jurisdiction) are expressly excluded.
[If any third party infringement of any of the Patents in the Territory interferes materially in the Licensee's business in the Licensed Products, subject to receiving advice from experienced patent counsel that infringement proceedings stand a reasonable chance of success, the Licensee may commence proceedings and may require the Licensor to lend its name to such proceedings and provide reasonable assistance, subject to the Licensee giving the Licensor an indemnity in respect of all costs, damages (including any damage suffered as a result of any challenge to the validity of the relevant Patent) and expenses that it may incur, including an award of costs against it, directly resulting from the Licensor's involvement in such proceedings. Where such proceedings are conducted by the Licensee, the Licensee may apply up to [50]% of all royalties due under clause 10 (Royalty) subsequent to the date of notification by the Licensee to the Licensor of the relevant infringement towards any costs directly incurred in relation to the proceedings. Any waiver of royalties by the Licensor shall only apply for as long as the Licensee actively pursues and properly conducts the proceedings. Any damages recovered by the Licensee in the proceedings shall first be applied to compensating the Licensor for any royalties waived under clause 11.4.]
Insofar as any of the Patents are either European Patent Applications or granted European patents in respect of which unitary effect by virtue of the Unitary Patent Regulation has not been requested:
the Licensor may in its absolute discretion request unitary effect in respect of any such patent or application; and 
the Licensor shall notify the Licensee within [30] Business Days of the making of any request under clause 11.5(a).
If the Licensor requests unitary effect under clause 11.5, the Licensor shall provide notice of the unitary effect to the Licensee within [30] Business Days of receipt of the notification of its unitary effect from the European Patent Office.
Subject to Article 83(3) of the UPC Agreement, the Licensor may at any time and in its absolute discretion opt out from the exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC any Non-unitary European Patent or European Patent Application.
Subject to Article 83(4) of the UPC Agreement, the Licensor may at any time and in its absolute discretion withdraw any opt-out from the exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC in respect of any Non-unitary European Patent or European Patent Application.
Nothing in this agreement shall constitute any representation or warranty that:
any Patent is valid or relevant to the Licensed Products;
any Patent (if a patent application) shall proceed to grant or, if granted, shall be valid; or
the exercise by the Licensee of rights granted under this agreement will not infringe the rights of any person.
Liability, indemnity and insurance
[In this clause:
Applicable Laws: all applicable laws, statutes, regulations [and codes] from time to time in force.
Losses: means all liabilities, damages, losses (including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of reputation, loss of savings and loss of opportunity), fines, expenses and costs (including all interest, penalties, legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and [reasonable] professional costs and expenses).

The Licensor shall not be liable to the Licensee for any Losses arising from the Licensee's exercise of the rights granted to it under this agreement.

the Licensee's exercise of the rights granted to it under this agreement;
the enforcement of this agreement;
[any claim by a third party arising out of or in connection with] defective Licensed Products supplied by the Licensee[, to the extent that the defect is attributable to the acts or omissions of the Licensee];
any damage to property arising out of or in connection with the acts or omissions of the Licensee; or
any action (including any investigation) by a Regulator or governmental authority arising out of or in connection with the Licensee's [acts or omissions OR breach of this agreement, negligence or failure to comply with Applicable Laws in the performance of this agreement].
[The indemnity in clause 12.3 applies whether or not the Licensor has been negligent or at fault.
OR
The Licensee will not be liable under the indemnity in clause 12.3 to the extent that any Losses result from the Licensor's breach of this agreement, negligence or wilful misconduct].
If any third party brings a claim against the Licensor, or notifies the Licensor of its intention to do so, and that claim may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under an indemnity (Claim), the Licensor shall:
as soon as reasonably practicable, give written notice of the Claim to the Licensee, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;
[subject to clause 12.6,] allow the Licensee, at the Licensee's cost, to conduct all negotiations and proceedings in relation to the Claim and to settle or compromise the Claim, provided that the Licensee must not settle or compromise the Claim [without the prior written consent of the licensor (consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) OR unless it involves only the payment of money by the Licensee and includes a complete release of the Licensor];
not[, subject to clause 12.6 and the Licensee's full compliance with clause 12.7,] make any admission of liability, settlement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Licensee [(that consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed)] [, provided that the Licensor may settle the Claim (after giving prior written notice of the terms of settlement (to the extent legally possible) to the Licensee, but without obtaining the Licensee's consent), if the Licensor [reasonably] believes that failure to settle the Claim would be prejudicial to it in any material respect]; and
provide the Licensee with reasonable information, assistance and co-operation in responding to and defending the Claim[, subject to the Licensee's compliance with clause 12.7(c)]. [This duty includes the Licensor giving the Licensee [and the Licensee's professional advisers] access at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to:
its premises and those of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers involved in the Claim; and 
any relevant accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Licensor, 
so that the Licensee [and the Licensee's professional advisers] can examine them and take copies (at the Licensee's expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim.]

OR

If a payment due from the Licensee under clause 12.3 is subject to tax (whether by way of direct assessment or withholding at its source), the amount of the payment shall be increased to ensure that the net receipt, after tax, to the Licensor is the same as it would have been were the payment not subject to tax.
[Nothing in this clause requires the Licensor to mitigate any Losses it may claim under an indemnity OR the Licensor shall use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate any Loss it may suffer or incur as a result of an event that may give rise to a claim under an indemnity].

OR
The Licensee shall have the right to subcontract the manufacture of the Licensed Products provided that:
any subcontractor shall first enter into a confidentiality agreement [direct with the Licensor in a form satisfactory to the Licensor OR with the Licensee and containing terms similar to, and no less onerous than, the provisions in clause 8 (Confidentiality) of this agreement and the Licensee agrees to monitor the subcontractor's compliance with such agreement and, if necessary, promptly enforce such agreement either on its own motion or at the request of the Licensor]; and
