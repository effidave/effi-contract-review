## Email Body

Hi Anna,

 

I am very sorry for the delay.

 

Please see attached for my comments.  Things to flag:

 

*	AI/machine learning (3.3., Ex. 1)– please check my proposed wording in Exhibit 1 carefully, especially the statements on training data, use of [CUSTOMER] Data. Please also add details of any third party suppliers you use for this.
*	Subcontractors/suppliers/service providers (3.4) – please list these in Exhibit 1 if they will have access to any [CUSTOMER] Data – n.b. this would include cloud service providers who merely host [CUSTOMER] data. 
*	IP in outputs (4) – please let me know if they are only able to use the outputs during the term of the agreement.  At the moment, they own the IP in the outputs.
*	Affiliates (3.1) – are you happy for the entire [CUSTOMER] group to benefit from the trial?
*	Warranties/indemnities (3.2 and 9 and 10) – see my comments on whether to push back or accept.
*	Data security (8 and Ex. 3) – I have proposed to limit Exhibit 3 to clauses 6 (Data Retention and Descruction), 8 (Cyber Security Incidents) and 9 (Application and Software Requirements) which look reasonable (and probably align with your existing practices).  Please check these look ok – or let me know if you would like me to provide more detail on this.
*	Liability cap (11) – I have added a general liability cap (100% of the fees) and a supercap of $1m for the indemnity in clause 10 (i.e. IPR, confidentiality, security).
*	Payment terms (5) – I have amended from 75 to 45 days, as per your email.

 

I have availability today if you would like to discuss anything or if you would like me to edit anything.

 

If you are comfortable with these changes, please delete the internal comments, marked For [SUPPLIER].   The comments marked For [CUSTOMER] are safe for sharing with them.

 

Thanks,

Dave
